    WHY THIS CAMEL POSE SEQUENCE WORKS

    Students who love Ustrasana, Camel Pose, praise the pose for the way it opens the shoulders, chest and upper-back. And, they’re right. 
    
    Camel Pose  is hard to beat when it comes to extending the thoracic spine. Students who loathe Ustrasana invariably complain about 
    discomfort in the neck and lower back. They’re also right. 
    It can be tough to do Ustrasana without creating excessive compression in your lower back and neck.
    
    As teachers, we know two things about how our students experience Ustrasana. Some students love the pose because it’s working for them; 
    and, some students don’t love the pose because it’s not working for them. For me, this becomes a puzzle to solve when I’m sequencing a class. 
    My goals are clear: I want to create a sequence that helps students maximize the benefits of Ustrasana (Camel Pose) while minimizing the 
    challenges of the posture.
    
    MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF CAMEL POSE
    To do this, the sequence below emphasizes a flow of postures that methodologically prepares your entire front body for Ustrasana. 
    When the front body—especially the hip flexors, quadriceps, abdominals, pectorals and anterior deltoids—are adequately prepared, 
    it’s more likely that your students will be able to open their shoulders and chest without crunching their lower back and neck.
    
    Here’s a really quick break down of my favorite mini-practice for Ustrasana (Camel Pose).
    
    POSES 1-3
    The first 3 postures allow you to settle into your body. Mild twisting is a nice preparation for yoga backbends. The following posture 
    flow is going to focus almost exclusively on lengthening the front body in preparation for backbends, so it’s nice to the sequence 
    with a little complementary work.
    
    POSES 4-6
    I really love this combination of poses and I use it in a lot of my sequences. It’s definitely a staple in my own practice. In each of these 
    postures your shoulder is in extension and one hip is in extension. This simultaneously lengthens the front of your shoulders, chest, hip-flexors 
    and quads. 
    

    The top arm is in the same chest-opening position as Ustrasana. These postures also introduce mild spinal extension. This mild backbending segues 
    perfectly into the next combination of postures.
    
    POSES 7-12
    This is a straightforward progression of backbends that goes from less demanding to more demanding. One of the reasons that I chose these postures 
    is that they all extend the shoulder joint, except for Cobra Pose. This shoulder extension will help open the front of the shoulders and chest 
    in preparation for Ustrasana.
    
    POSE 13
    Lucky number 13—Ustrasana! This is still a tough posture for most students, but here are 3 quick tips for working with the posture. 1) Engage the 
    bottom of your Gluteus Maximus. Yes, engage them. 2) Externally rotate your arms so that your biceps and elbow creases are turning away from each 
    other. This will help lift your chest in the pose. 3) If the pose is still uncomfortable in your neck, tuck your chin and look toward your chest. 
    If the pose is uncomfortable in your lower back, place your hands on the back of your pelvis. Use your thumbs to lengthen the back of your pelvis 
    downward. Take your time and do what you need to do in order to befriend the pose.
    
    POSES 14-15
    The word “perfect” is nauseatingly overused. But, I’m going to add to the problem and write that Supta Padangusthasana is the “perfect” follow-up 
    to Ustrasana and other backbends. Unlike Happy Baby Pose, which flexes the spine, Supta Padangusthasana allows you to maintain the natural curves 
    of the spine. This is a mild transition for your back after all the extension you created in your backbends. It also allows you a few moments to 
    feel (and possibly savor) the afterglow of your backbends. Viparita Karani is your just desserts.]],

    I typically meditate first thing in the morning and a short yoga sequence helps me shake off sleepiness before I settle 
    in to meditation. This is just one sequence that I love to do before meditating and it only takes a few minutes.
    
    This one hits all of the spots to prepare you for a more comfortable meditation — you open the shoulders and chest, bring some heat and 
    fluidity to the hips and hamstrings, and stretch the side body.
    
    POSES 1 & 2
    Note: It’s a good idea to get your props ready – like a cushion or blankets – so that at the end of this sequence, you can go right into 
    your meditation.
    
    Start in in Sukhasana (Easy Pose) and place your hands in a comfortable position – the hands are in prayer here, but you can also bring 
    your hands to your heart or face down on your knees.
    
    Take three deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.
    
    When you’re ready, place your right hand on left knee and twist to the left. 5 deep breaths.
    
    Come back to center and switch sides.
    
    POSES 3 & 4
    You can either stay inEasy Pose or sit up on your shins. Interlace your fingers and reach your arms overhead, feeling length in your 
    side body. Stay for 5 breaths.
    
    Release your fingers and sweep your arms in front of you, bringing your right arm under your left. Bend at the elbows and wrap the 
    forearms until your right fingers press into your left palm. 5 deep breaths, eyes soft.
    
    Then release and do the other side.
    
    POSES 5 & 6
    Come to hands and knees and warm up your spine. Inhale as you tilt the hips forward, reach the chest forward and look up. Exhale as you 
    tilt the hips back and round the spine. 
    
    Move at a pace that feels good to you and do 10 rounds.
    
    From there, tuck your toes and lift your hips into Down Dog. Adjust your stance as you need to. Check in with your body and try to figure 
    out where you need to focus today. It might feel good to focus on getting length in the spine; or you might bend one knee at a time, 
    warming up the legs. Stay for 5-10 breaths.
    
    POSES 7 & 8
    Bring your right foot forward and come into a low lunge. Press into the front foot and tuck the tailbone to feel a stretch along the front 
    of the left thigh.
    
    As you feel steady, clasp hands behind you and lift the chest. Stay for three more breaths, then switch sides, coming to Downward Dog in between.
    
    From Down Dog, sit down and bring your legs wide. Take a deep breath or two, gaining length in your spine. As you’re ready, 
    fold over your right leg. Breathe and release any expectation. Come back to center and switch sides.
    
    POSE 9
    This reclined version of Gomukhasana (Cow Face Pose) feels great and it’s easier to control the depth of the stretch than the upright version.
    
    Lie on your back and cross the right knee over left. Place your hands on your ankles. You don’t have to pull! Be mindful that you don’t 
    stress your knees – 
    
    if there’s pain in your knees, back off.
    
    Stay for five deep breaths, then switch sides.
    
    When you’ve finished, roll to your right side and sit up. With your props nearby, you’re ready to meditate.]],

    WHY THIS SEQUENCE WORKS

    I spent my first two years of yoga avoiding Warrior III. Then, I spent another year avoiding it. Finally, after avoiding it for an 
    additional 15 years, I’ve made it a mainstay of my practice. What can I say? I guess it takes me a while to warm up to things that 
    expose my weaknesses, knock me off balance, and frustrate my ego. I have to admit, I actually like it now.
    
    Part of the reason I avoided the pose was that I didn’t feel that I should struggle with it nearly as much as I was. The degree of 
    difficultly that I experienced didn’t seem commensurate with the challenge of the pose. After all, standing postures like Utthita 
    Hasta Padangusthasana, arm balances like Eka Pada Galavasana, and balancing in inversions like Forearm Balance and Handstand weren’t 
    very difficult for me. But, three seconds into Warrior III and I would topple over.
    
    Now that I’m no longer avoiding the pose, I’ve figured out a few things that make it much more accessible and effective. Go figure, 
    now that I’m not avoiding something, I’m actually learning about it—shocker. What incredible insights yoga teachers have, right?
    
    Here are the things that I’m focusing on in the pose:
    
    1) Strongly rooting down through the base of the big toe.
    2) Strongly adducting both thighs toward each other like I’m squeezing a block.
    3) Engaging the spinal muscles and hamstrings (of the top leg) like I’m doing Locust Pose.
    4) Firmly pressing my hands together in Anjali Mudra for a few breaths to help me feel the midline of my body before reaching my arms forward.
    5) Holding my breath, thinking about the future, judging myself, and assigning blame to others.
    
    Here’s a quick sequence to help you build up to Warrior III. I’ve been enjoying this sequence quite a bit lately.
    
    POSES 1-2
    Simple, straightforward reclined Hamstring and Adductor lengthening to prepare for the upcoming demands of Warrior III.
    
    POSES 3-4
    Paripurna Navasana and Ardha Navasana pair perfectly to strengthen your core. Bringing your attention to your center early in this sequence 
    will help you keep your attention focused on your midline when you get the wobbles in Warrior III later.
    
    POSES 5-6
    These two poses help you transition from the reclined and seated postures to the upcoming standing postures.
    
    POSES 7-9
    This is a progression of standing balances with the legs abducted and externally rotated. These postures will get you tuned in to standing 
    balances and they’re typically easier than the upcoming standing balances.
    
    POSES 10-12
    These three postures shift the orientation of the legs and hips into the same orientation as the upcoming Warrior III.
    
    POSES 13-15
    Parsvottanasana gives you one more opportunity to prepare your hamstrings for Warrior III. Many teachers transition into Warrior III from 
    Warrior I. I prefer transitioning into Warrior III from a high lunge. I think it makes more sense for the hips. Check it out and see what 
    you think.]],

    You know those poses that you once loathed, but now you love? At first, they had the audacity to make you feel awkward, 
    imbalanced, and mortal. Then, somehow, they started scratching an itch that no other posture could. You know the ones. For me Parivrtta 
    Trikonasana, or Revolved Triangle, is at the top of this list.
    
    Things changed for me in Parivrtta Trikonasana when I started working with the pose differently. My experience shifted when I started 
    putting it later in my sequences. I remember when I was an Ashtanga practitioner thinking that Parivrtta Trikonasa was too early in the 
    standing sequence for my body. It was the first posture in the sequence to stretch my IT bands, adductors, external rotators and rotational 
    spinal muscles. Even though I was in my early 20s, all of these muscles and connective tissues were pretty tight and Parivrtta Trikonasana 
    was a slog.
    
    The pose was enough of a frustration for me during my Primary Series days that I started to prep for it with a few outer-hip and IT band 
    openers before class. I could accept that Marichyasana D was hard, but I couldn’t quite cope with the fact that I struggled with the fourth 
    posture in the standing series. 
    
    Eventually, as I moved away Ashtanga Yoga, I started building sequences that were entirely designed to make greater peace with Parivritta 
    Trikonasana and address the tight spots that this posture revealed in my body.
    
    This sequence came about from many years of trying to relocate Parivrtta Trikonasana from my “No thanks, I’d rather not,” list, to my “Yes, 
    please—and I’ll have A few more,” list. 
    
    Like all of my sequences, it’s accessible, simple, straightforward, and effective.
    
    Take a few moments to look at the sequence before you practice it and you’ll quickly see why it makes sense. It includes everything that 
    you’ll need to prepare your body for Parivrtta Trikonasana and presents these components in a straightforward progression. Fingers crossed 
    that it works as well for you as it’s worked for me over the years.
    
    And, hey, while we’re at it, let me know some of the yoga poses that you’re still struggling with in the comments section and how you’re 
    going about managing them. Maybe I’ll create a sequence just for you!]],

    Full disclaimer: when it comes to the morning, I’m a coffee first kind of guy. Yoga is a close second. But, it’s second nonetheless. It 
    wasn’t always this way, but nothing is permanent. So, if you’re like me and you prefer some liquid inspiration to get yourself on the 
    mat first thing, don’t judge yourself. Once you’re ready, here’s a solid, get-up-and-go practice.
    
    This is a pretty simple, straightforward sequence. You don’t need to revolutionize the future of yoga sequencing before noon. You just 
    need to ease into your body, get moving, turn upside down a time or two and chase the cobwebs away with some backbends.
    
    Morning Yoga Flow 
    
    Sequence
    The sequence starts with three opening postures — Child’s Pose, Downward Dog, and Ardha Uttanasana — to slowly stretch the back of your 
    body. Then, you transition into Sun Salutations. I have “Surya Namaskar A” listed here, but you can do any style of Sun Salutation that 
    you like. I take my first couple of Salutations incredibly slowly. It wasn’t always this way, but, again, nothing is permanent. Take as 
    many as you like and move at whatever pace you prefer.
    
    Next, you’ll jump into a progression of standing poses. I like to practice Warrior II-based postures prior to Warrior I-based postures, 
    because they’re easier for my hips. This is the order that I’ve chosen for this sequence, but I don’t have a black and white rule about 
    it. I used to, but nothing is permanent.
    
    After you’ve done a few openers, done as many Salutations as you fancy, and worked through your standing postures, it’s time to get upside 
    down. If you’re not practicing Handstand, you could do Half-Handstand with your feet at the wall. Or, you could omit the inversion entirely. 
    If you have a few tricks up your sleeve and want to do additional inversions or arm balances, go for it.
    
    The sequence concludes with Bridge Pose and Upward Bow Pose, followed by Supta Padangusthasana. My backbends feel even tighter in the morning 
    than in the afternoon. It’s always been this way — some things never change. Supta Padangusthasana grounds you after your backbends and rounds 
    out the sequence. A brief Savasana or Seated Meditation is a nice way to fully close the practice. Usually, I include these, but I’m honest 
    enough to tell you that sometimes I don’t. Once in awhile, it feels like I spent the entire morning sequence trying not to feel like a corpse.
    
    OK, enjoy your practice!]],

    description=[[
    I know back pain. I’ve dealt with varying degrees of back pain—from mild to severe—for more than 20 years. I’ve also worked with hundreds 
    of students that have similar challenges. Whether their doctor has suggested trying yoga for back pain or they’ve just exhausted all other 
    options, many students turn to yoga when they’re facing lower-back problems.
    
    My yoga practice has provided me with an exceptional tool for managing my back and minimizing flare-ups. At the same time, there’s no 
    one-size-fits-all formula for using yoga for back pain. Postures that soothe some students, agitate others. Yoga is for everybody, but not 
    all postures are for everybody. With this in mind, the goal of this sequence is to provide you with some general principles and a simple 
    sequence that may help you with general, overall lower-back maintenance. I’m hopeful that many of these postures–if not the entire 
    sequence–will help you keep back discomfort at bay if you practice them regularly.
    
    Of course, this sequence is not for acute pain, nor does it account for (or provide) specific diagnoses. If you’re in acute pain, please 
    find a medical provider. Also, please omit all postures that are contrary to your medical provider’s suggestions.
    
    One more thought: A detailed examination of yoga for back pain is beyond the scope of this blog post. But, before you launch into this 
    sequence, there are a few important principles to pay attention to:
    
    My Approach to Yoga for Back Pain
    1. Focus on maintaining the natural curves of your spine, especially the lordotic curve of your lower back.
    2. Focus on hip and leg flexibility. Yes, some students need more stability in these regions. But, generally speaking, excessive tension 
    in the hips and legs needs to be addressed so that the pelvis can be in it’s proper position in daily life and in yoga postures.
    3. Breathe slowly, smoothly, and deeply. Breathing settles the inclination for the nervous system to overreact and helps facilitate spinal motion.
    4. Remember that there’s going to be a little trial and error. Some things will work for you and some things won’t.
    5. Back off when something hurts. Period.
    6. Lastly, all hygiene requires consistency. Consider this sequence good hygiene for your lower back. Got it?
    
    Back feeling fine? Try Eka Pada Urdhva Dhanurasana or Ustrasana.
    
    WHY THIS SEQUENCE WORKS

    POSES 1-5
    Reclined hip, hamstring, and inner leg (adductor) openers should be the bread and butter of lower back maintenance strategies. Yes, a strong and 
    stable core is essential for lower back comfort. But, if excessive hip, hamstring, or adductor tension is keeping your pelvis out of proper 
    alignment, no amount of core strength is going to protect your lower back.
    
    These first three poses are so valuable that you can practice them on their own — especially if you’re not comfortable with the following 
    postures. The first four postures of this sequence don’t require your lower back or pelvis to move. Instead, you keep your lower back and 
    pelvis stationary and move your leg. Most of you will need to hold a yoga strap instead of holding your foot. The 5th posture introduces 
    a mild reclined twist in order to help you create more mobility in your thoracic spine (the part of your spine that your ribs connect to).
    
    POSES 6-8
    In addition to mobilizing your hips, hamstrings, and adductors, strengthening your core is essential for lower back comfort. Two of the 
    most effective core strengtheners in yoga are what I call “Core Connector” (pose 6) and Forearm Plank (pose 8). These poses require very 
    little spinal flexion (anterior spinal rounding) to execute correctly. If the minor rounding of your spine in the “Core Connector” is 
    uncomfortable, do a few rounds of Forearm Plank instead. In this sequence, I threw in Down Dog between the two core postures to help you 
    focus on lengthening your spine, which can help alleviate back discomfort.
    
    POSES 9-10
    Most people love to alternate between Cat Pose and Cow Pose. I don’t. Honestly, I just don’t find Cow Pose to be comfortable or effective 
    in my body. Cat, I like. Cow, I can live without. So, I selected Sphinx Pose to pair with Cat Pose instead. Sphinx is the first pose in 
    these sequence where you’re taking your back into extension. As you do this pose, don’t let your belly sink heavily into the floor since 
    this may arch your lower back too intensely. Instead, gently press your pubic bone into the floor and draw your lower belly toward your spine. 
    
    Notice how this pose feels in your lower back. Some of you will crave more, some of you will want to get out sooner rather than later.
    
    POSES 11-14
    Hip openers should be a staple in your back care routine. 
    
    Pigeon Pose is most notable for the stretch it delivers to the outer and posterior hips — especially gluteus maximus and the six external 
    rotators that live under glute max. But, Pigeon Pose — like the two postures that follow it in this sequence — also lengthens the hip flexors 
    that lay on the front of the pelvis. This is particularly true for those you with exceptionally tight hip flexors. 
    
    Posture 13 adds the hip flexor lengthening by also stretching the quadriceps. This group is rounded out with a lunging twist since mild twists 
    feel so good for many people with muscular tension in their back.
    
    POSES 15-16
    Closing a sequence with a mild twist and a mild forward bend like Child’s Pose is soothing for nearly everyone who struggles with lower back 
    discomfort. You can make Child’s Pose even more effective by directing your inhalations toward your lower back.

    WHY THIS SEQUENCE WORKS
    
    Your shoulders have a lot of moving parts. Each shoulder has 4 joints (GH, AC, SC, ST), plus layers and layers of soft tissues that 
    include muscles, tendons, and ligaments. When you add the physical demands that the shoulders undergo on a daily basis to the complexity 
    of the region, you wind up with an unavoidable truth: Your shoulders need regular—if not daily maintenance—if you want your upper-body 
    to be functional and comfortable.
    
    ONE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT YOUR SHOULDERS, NECK, AND UPPER-BACK
    
    We frequently take our body for granted. Even as yoga practitioners, we often forget the intricate subtlety and profound majesty of the 
    body. When we take our body for granted, we forget that it needs our attention and care. We forget that our body needs regular—if not 
    daily maintenance—especially as our body ages. I’ve watched my body through my yoga practice for 20 years and it’s finally become clear 
    that my shoulders, neck, and upper-back need a simple, quick, daily practice if I want them to work optimally. I created the following 
    sequence for myself a few months ago and I’ve been extremely consistent with it. It’s usually not the entirety of my practice or training 
    on any given day. Rather, it’s a supplement. It’s simple, basic, and hugely effective. Think about it as the equivalent of brushing your 
    teeth or taking a shower. It’s just basic hygiene that helps you feel better.
    
    My recommendation is to do this sequence several days a week. It’s only going to take 10-15 minutes and it will be worth every moment. 
    If you have a regular yoga practice, sneak this in at the end of your sequence. If you train, run, workout, or ride a desk all-day long, 
    do this sequence in the evening before you go to bed. Just figure out a way to put this into your routine.
    
    Yoga for Shoulders and Neck | Yoga Sequence to Relieve Tension in the Shoulders, Neck and Upper Back

    POSES 1-3 :  Child’s Pose and Cat Pose
    Child’s Pose and Cat Pose gently round the upper-back and release tension in the muscles that lay between the shoulder-blades. Since the 
    head hangs freely in these postures, the muscles in the neck don’t have to work to support the weight of the head. 
    
    This creates a nice, much needed rest for these often over-worked muscles.
    
    POSES 3-6: Yoga for Shoulders and Neck Tension
    If you practice with me live, online or with these illustrated sequences, you’ll recognize this straightforward, 4-pose shoulder-opening 
    combination. I use this mini-sequence all the time. In fact, you can think about these 4 poses as a “mini shoulder-opening sequence” within 
    a sequence. If you don’t have time to do this entire practice, these 4 poses will knock plenty of the rust off of your shoulders by themselves. 
    These postures will help create mobility in your shoulders by taking them through a significant range of motion. If sitting in Virasana is 
    difficult for you—or, you want a little more movement in your practice—you can do this combination of shoulder openers in Tadasana, Warrior 1 
    or Warrior 2.
    
    POSES 7-10: Shoulder Opening Lunge and Forward Bends
    Poses 7 – 10 are included to get you moving a little bit more. Even though this sequence is mellow, it’s nice to have a few poses where you can 
    feel your body work. If you externally rotate your upper-arms and broaden your shoulder-blades properly, you will release the weight of your 
    head and neck in down dog. This will help stretch the space between your shoulder-blades. Low lunge with your fingers interlaced behind your 
    back will stretch your the front of your shoulders and chest. The two wide-legged standing forward bends will stretch your entire back-body and 
    release tension in your upper-body by letting the weight of your head and neck to drop.
    
    POSE 11: Dolphin Pose with Hands at Wall
    Down Dog with the elbows on the floor and the hands on the wall is one of my favorite shoulder openers. It creates the same effect as Down Dog, 
    but it increases the amount of leverage that you can stretch your shoulders with. To do this posture effectively, place your hands on the wall 
    with your fingers pointing away from each other (your thumbs will face the ceiling). Keep your elbows shoulder-width apart. The most common 
    mistake that people make when they’re practicing this pose is to lean their shoulders toward the wall. Instead—just like you do in Down Dog
    —press your shoulders toward your legs.

    WHY THIS SARVANGASANA (SHOULDERSTAND) SEQUENCE WORKS
    I’m going to start this article with the same caveat that I included in my Headstand sequence: This practice is not designed to teach 
    you Shoulderstand. Rather, it’s designed to break down the elements that comprise good, skillful sequencing for Shoulderstand (Sarvangasana).  
    It’s only intended for students and teachers who are already proficient in this posture. If you’re not regularly practicing Shoulderstand, 
    please learn the pose in the presence of a qualified instructor.
    
    Shoulderstand (also known as Sarvangasana) is a simple posture, except for one glaring component—the shoulders. It’s fitting that the shoulders 
    are the exceptional aspect of the posture that bears its’ name. When the shoulders don’t comply with the posture, they create misalignments 
    that can wreak havoc on the neck and make the entire posture feel out of whack.
    
    Fortunately, a good sequence for Shoulderstand can help prepare your body where you need it most: 
    the front of your shoulders, chest, hip flexors, and quads. Your shoulders need to extend and adduct in order to get into the optimal position 
    for Shoulderstand. To visualize this: Imagine swinging your upper arms back behind you, bending your elbows, and hugging your elbows toward 
    each other. Otherwise, your elbows will splay away from each other, you’ll lose stability that your shoulders provide, and you’ll overload 
    your neck. The combination of extending and adducting your shoulders actions is not easy, which is why the sequence below focuses so heavily 
    on anterior (front) shoulder and chest opening.
    
    Admittedly, the flexibility of your hip flexors and quads is not as important as the flexibility of your shoulders. But, excessive tension 
    in these muscle groups can negatively impact your overall posture, especially when you’re upside-down.
    
    Let’s break it down a little further:
    
    POSES 1-3
    This sequence starts off with Ardha Supta Virasana, Down Dog, and Low Lunge with fingers clasped behind the back. These postures introduce 
    three essential components of Shoulderstand. You open the front of your shoulders and chest in the low lunge, you open your hip flexors and 
    quads in Ardha Supta Virasana, and you get upside down in Downward-Facing Dog.
    
    POSES 4 – 8
    Postures 4-8 form the heart of this sequence. I snuck Reverse Warrior into the mix because it’s wise to do sidebends before backbend and 
    because the posture adds some variety and balance to the sequence. Transitioning from Reverse Warrior to Ardha Chandrasana with the foot 
    clasped is a nice, simple combination. Ardha Chandrasana with the foot clasped helps prepare you for the sequence of backbends to follow 
    since it stretches the hip flexors and quads. I can’t emphasize enough how integral opening the front of the chest, shoulders, and thoracic 
    spine is to a healthy Shoulderstand. Towards this end, postures 6, 7, and 8 are a straightforward progression of backbends. Bridge Pose is 
    the simplest of the three backbends and so it could have been first in the series, not last. But, Bridge Pose does such a great job of 
    replicating the actions of the upper body in Shoulderstand that I wanted to include it as the final backbend in the series.
    
    POSES 9 – 10
    If you wanted a shorter sequence, you could skip poses 9 & 10. In fact, I like the idea of going from poses 4-8 straight into Plow and 
    Shoulderstand nearly as much as I like including postures 9 & 10. Going straight from postures 4-8 into Shoulderstand provides you with 
    the continuity of opening your chest since these postures focus so heavily on opening your chest and shoulders. That said, I’m including 
    Child’s Pose and seated forward bend in this sequence prior to Shoulderstand because they’re good for soothing the nervous system. Ideally, 
    Shoulderstand is a deeply nurturing, quieting posture. Practicing Child’s Pose and seated forward bend before Plow Pose and Shoulderstand 
    may make these postures more beneficial by helping you settle your nervous system.
    
    POSES 11 – 12
    Plow Pose provides the perfect transition into Shoulderstand and out of Shoulderstand. There’s no mystery here. Enjoy.]],

    WHY THIS YOGA HEADSTAND SEQUENCE WORKS
    Let me start with a big caveat about this practice: This yoga headstand practice is NOT designed to teach you Headstand.
    
    Rather, it’s designed to help you refine your Headstand by breaking down the elements that comprise good, skillful sequencing for the 
    pose. It’s only intended for students and teachers who are already proficient in this posture. If you’re not regularly practicing yoga 
    Headstand, please learn the pose in the presence of a qualified instructor. If you have never done Headstand, please don’t attempt it 
    alone at home. Instead, you can choose to replace Headstand with Dolphin Pose in this sequence.
    
    From a purely mechanical perspective, Headstand is a simple posture. Like all postures, Headstand contains plenty of nuances, especially 
    with regards to the action of the shoulders and placement of the head. However in my experience, the most challenging aspect of the posture 
    is becoming oriented upside down. Unlike deep backbends or forward bends, you don’t have to focus on a ton of strengthening or stretching 
    to prepare for Headstand. Rather, you have to prepare your body, mind, and nervous system for the finer points of being aligned while you’re 
    upside down.
    
    Let’s break it down a little further:
    
    POSES 1-3
    The sequence starts with Cat Pose in order to bring your awareness to your shoulders and upper back. It’s nice to release tension in this 
    region and bring your focus to your shoulder blades when you’re preparing for Headstand. The sequence continues with Plank and Forearm Plank 
    in order to engage your core. Core strength is not as important in Headstand as it is in Handstand and Forearm Balance (Pincha Mayurasana) 
    since the posture is less mechanically stressful for your midsection. At the same time, it’s important to be mindful of the role that your 
    core plays in keeping your pelvis, spine, and ribs vertically aligned in Headstand.
    
    POSES 4 – 7
    Poses 4 – 7 prepare you for Headstand by turning you upside down. Since Down Dog and the forward bends are slightly inverted postures, they 
    can help you adjust to being upside down prior to Headstand. These four postures may also promote the focus and attention needed to tune into 
    the finer points of Headstand.
    
    POSES 8 – 11
    You don’t need exceptionally flexible shoulders to do Headstand, but you do need to have a clear awareness of what your shoulders are doing 
    in the posture. Postures 8 - 11 are a progression of shoulder-opening postures that will mobilize your shoulder joints and help you focus 
    your attention on your upper body. Baddha Hastasana, Gomukhasana, and Down Dog with your hands on the wall prepares your shoulders for the 
    flexion that is required in Headstand. Garudasana complements these postures by preparing your shoulder blades for the protraction that is 
    required in Headstand.
    
    POSES 12 – 13
    Most of the sequences I provide here conclude with the peak, or featured posture. I want to help students and teachers understand how to make 
    challenging postures more accessible with smart, effective, and safe sequencing. Headstand is no exception, but the final posture in this 
    sequence is Child’s Pose, not Headstand. It’s important to follow Headstand with Child’s Pose in order to help decompress the neck, relieve 
    muscular tension there, and provide you with a few moments of stillness to savor the effects of the inversion.]],

    WHY THIS EKA PADA KOUNDINYASANA SEQUENCE WORKS
    When I practice difficult postures I have to be strategic. Since I don’t have the natural flexibility or raw strength to will myself into 
    advanced postures like Eka Pada Koundinyasana, I have to emphasize preparation, efficient leverage, and technique. For me, this means 
    breaking down difficult postures into small, accessible components.
    
    EKA PADA KOUNDINYASANA QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
    I typically ask myself three questions when I look at a demanding posture like Eka Pada Koundinyasana I:
    
    1. What are the legs and hips doing in the pose?
    2. What are the core and spine doing in the pose?
    3. What are the shoulders and arms doing in the pose?
    
    It’s a simple, straightforward process that helps me — and can help you — take a complex pose and boil it down into manageable parts. 
    One benefit of this process is that it provides you with aspects of every posture that you can work on even if you can’t do a particular 
    pose in its’ entirety.
    
    When I apply these questions to Eka Pada Koundinyasana I, I get simple, straightforward answers. The hips, legs, spine, and core are in 
    Parivrrta Trikonasana The shoulders and arms are in Chaturanga. In other words, Eka Pada Koundinyasana I, is Revolved Triangle Pose on 
    top of Chaturanga. So, this sequence focuses on preparing for a deep Revolved Triangle Pose and a strong Chaturanga.
    
    Let’s break it down a little further:
    
    POSES 1-4
    The first three postures will wake up your core. More specifically, the 2nd and 3rd postures in the sequence will fire-up your obliques 
    since they include a demanding twist. These postures set the tone for the sequence by providing you with a preview of the postures and 
    actions that will follow. The 4th posture, Downward Facing Dog, gives you a smooth transition from the reclined postures to the hip-opening 
    lunges.
    
    POSES 5-6
    Admittedly, the hamstrings and adductors—which are focused on in pose #5—are not huge components of Eka Pada Koundinyasana. But, those of 
    you with tight hamstrings will benefit from the inclusion of lizard pose, since it will prepare you for Revolved Triangle and Revolved Half 
    Moon. Practicing Pigeon Pose will prepare you for the upcoming twists by creating more mobility in your outer hips and IT bands.
    
    POSES 7-11
    Poses 7 through 10 give you a straightforward progression of standing twists. Each twist builds on the previous twist as the progression 
    slowly increases in demand. These postures prepare your outer hips, IT bands, and spine for the demands of Eka Pada Koundinyasana. 
    The 11th pose, Revolved Utkatasana, provides you with a standing twist that closely resembles the next posture in the sequence—Side Crow, 
    or Parsva Bakasana.
    
    POSES 12-13
    Parsva Bakasana is the foundation for all arm balances that include a twist. When you develop the strength, flexibility and overall 
    coordination to do this pose proficiently, you’re also setting the stage for other twisting variations. Also, Parsva Bakasana is a great 
    pose for transitioning into Eka Pada Koudinyasana.]],

    WHY THE PARIVRTTA JANU SIRSASANA SEQUENCE WORKS
    Nothing beats a good side-bending practice. And, truthfully, the recipe for the classic posture Parivrtta Janu Sirsasana is simple: the 
    practice needs to focus on stretching the hamstrings, adductors, and the sides of the torso (which are largely comprised of the lats, 
    obliques, and the quadratus lumborum). The sequence above sticks to these three basic focal points.
    
    Let’s break it down a little further:
    
    POSES 1–2
    What could be better than resting on your back and stretching your hamstrings and adductors? Not much. Supta Padangusthasana A & B are 
    simple, effective, energy-saving postures that target your hamstrings and adductors and allow you to transition into your practice gently.
    
    POSES 3-4
    You really can’t go wrong with Down Dog and Three-Legged Down Dog. You can use them in nearly any sequence, but I like them here because 
    they continue the work of stretching your hamstrings, they lengthen your spine (which is helpful in side bends), and they provide a smooth 
    transition from reclined to standing postures.
    
    POSES 5-7
    This combination of postures flows together smoothly and builds on the work of you’ve already established by opening your side body. An 
    important note here is that most students will only receive a mild stretch in their side body in these postures. This is ideal sequencing 
    because you don’t want the first side bends in a sequence to be intense or abrupt. Most students don’t spend a ton of time working their 
    side bends, so the muscles involved (lats, obliques, and quadratus lumborum) need to be prepared slowly.
    
    POSES 8-9
    These postures hone in on the hamstrings, adductors and side body. At this phase of the sequence, you’re going more deeply into the targeted 
    areas of this practice.
    
    POSES 10-13
    This progression of poses takes you deeper and deeper into your hamstrings, adductors, and side body. If you have more flexibility, you 
    can bend your bottom elbow and take it to the floor in gate pose (pose 12). Once you arrive in Parivrtta Janu Sirsasana, remember to bend 
    your top elbow and lean your upper-body slightly back. Breathe into the side of the waist you’re stretching and savor the pose. If you’re 
    stuck and struggling, there’s a 99% chance that the restriction is in your hamstrings and adductors. 
    
    If this is the case, be diligent with the first 8 postures of this sequence for a few more months.]],

    WHY THIS FLYING PIGEON SEQUENCE WORKS
    Eka Pada Galavasana is not an easy posture, but it’s a simple posture. If you take a step back and look at the pose, you’ll see it’s 
    a combination of Pigeon Pose and Chaturanga Dandasana. Even more precisely, it’s Pigeon Pose on top of Chaturanga. This means that 
    there’s no mystery when it comes to sequencing for Eka Pada Galavasana: Your job is to prepare yourself (or your students) for a solid, 
    skillful Chaturanga and a spacious, supple Pigeon Pose. The sequence above does this by focusing on core strength, upper body strength, 
    and outer hip flexibility. Here’s a detailed look at the method behind the sequence:
    
    POSES 1 & 2
    If you’ve practiced with me live, on yogaglo, or with these sequencing illustrations, you’ve probably figured out that I start a ton of 
    sequences on my back. This is a reflection of my personal practice which almost invariably commences with me laying on the floor—especially 
    if I know that I’m going to work hard later in the sequence. 
    
    It’s an incredibly effective, low energy way to create mobility in the hips, hamstrings, and spine. The first two postures provide good bang 
    for your buck. They require very little effort and they produce a fair amount of leverage to start chipping away at hip tension.
    
    POSES 3 – 5
    Not everything you practice on your back is effortless. This combination of reclined arm balances will wake up your core, get your blood moving, 
    and heat your body in very little time.
    
    POSES 6 & 7
    Now that your body is a little warmer after your reclined arm balances, it’s time to dig into your hips a little deeper. 
    
    Postures 6 and 7 will help warm up your body for the even deeper outer hip openers that directly precede Eka Pada Galavasana.
    
    POSTURES 8 & 9
    I wrote earlier that Eka Pada Galavasana was a combination of Pigeon and Chaturanga. I’m sticking with this assessment, but there’s 
    an important nuance that postures 8 & 9 address. Neither Pigeon nor Chaturanga require significant engagement of your hamstrings or 
    spinal muscles, but, Eka Pada Galavasana does. Your hamstrings and spinal muscles help elevate your back leg in Eka Pada Galavasana–this 
    isn’t required in Pigeon or Chaturanga. Postures 8 & 9 help integrate these muscles into your overall body awareness so that you’re ready 
    to use them in the upcoming arm balance.
    
    POSTURES 10 – 13
    This is a straightforward progression of deeper and deeper outer hip openers that culminates in Eka Pada Galavasana. If you struggle to 
    get your shin on top of your elbows and place your hands on the floor, your hips may be too tight for the pose. If this is the case, 
    practice the hip openers in this sequence more consistently. If you can get the position above, but struggle to lift your bottom foot 
    and straighten your bottom leg toward the back of the mat, you may need to work on core, upper-body, and spinal strength. Good luck!]],

    description=[[
    WHY THIS FOREARM STAND SEQUENCE WORKS
    This sequence leading to Forearm Stand focuses on creating greater range of movement in your shoulders. Tightness in the shoulders—particularly 
    flexion of the shoulder joint—will distort the spine, pelvis, and legs. More often than not, these distortions produce a banana shape in the 
    posture. When the vertical integrity of the posture is lost because the body has moved into a banana shape, it’s harder to sustain the posture 
    because the rest of your body is overworking to compensate. Core strength can minimize this banana shape pattern, but it’s important to work at 
    the root of the problem, which is almost always the shoulders.
    
    Poses 1-4 
    will stretch your shoulders and upper back and prepare you for the demands of Handstand and Pincha Mayurasana or Forearm Balance. I included two 
    postures to stretch your rhomboids—Garudasana Arms and Cat Pose—because these postures help your scapulae and allow rotate more easily. Scapular 
    rotation essential for all postures that take your arms overhead, especially inversions.
    
    Poses 5-6 
    begin to warm up your entire body. Down Dog continues to stretch your shoulders and arms, while the Low Lunge with your fingers interlaced releases 
    tension on the front of your shoulders, abs, and hip-flexors.
    
    Poses 7-10 
    introduce balancing postures to the sequence. I always find that standing balances prior to hand balances help remind me to go slow and focus on 
    my contact points with the floor. This helps prepare my mind for the demands of hand balances. Reverse Warrior is a nice inclusion in this 
    sequence because it releases tension in the side body, especially the lats. Tension in the lats is one of the largest obstacles to Forearm Balance.]],

    Practicing first thing in the morning has never been easy for me. But, I’ve adapted to the early hours by creating a simple, brief morning 
    yoga sequence that slowly eases my body open. It’s illustrated above. In fact, doing a mellow practice in the morning is something I’ve 
    started looking forward to—and, yes, I usually savor a cup of coffee prior to the first pose, or along with the sequence. Call the yoga 
    police if you must. If I want to do a more demanding yoga flow—which I usually save for the afternoon—I can easily use the sequence above 
    as template. Once I get my body moving and generate some momentum, I can insert more challenging postures or include some demanding standing 
    pose combinations.
    
    This sequence is simple, balanced, and brief since it’s designed to help you be consistent with your practice in the new year. You’ll start 
    in Child’s Pose to release tension in your back before transitioning into a simple twist and forward bend. I start 99% of my home practices 
    this way.
    
    You will pick up intensity once you get into Down Dog and do both sides of Lunging Quad Stretch. Linger over these poses as long as you 
    like. While you’re doing these postures, establish a long, slow breathing cadence. From there, you can insert any style of Sun Salutation you 
    want to practice at this phase of the sequence. Do between 3-10 rounds. (Check out this infographic for Sun Salutation A and Sun Salutation B, 
    if you need more info about Sun Salutations.)
    
    Poses 7-10 are a straightforward combination of standing poses that will strengthen your legs, open your hips, and condition your entire body. 
    If you want to include additional standing poses or sneak a few arm balances into your sequence, this is where they should go.
    
    The sequence concludes with a mild backbend, a neutral posture, and seated meditation. You’re welcome to intensify your backbends by including 
    Bow Pose (Dhanurasana) or Upward Bow aka Wheel Pose. (You can go here for a tutorial on Upward Bow.]],

    I hear more sweet sighs of relief when I teach yoga sequences that focus on side-bends than any other posture category. Side-bending in 
    poses like Compass Pose releases tension in the lats, obliques, and QLs, leaving students in a momentary state of suspension where 
    everything feels better than it did a moment ago.
    
    Compass Pose is a deep side bend that differs from its close relatives, Parivrtta Janu Sirsasana and Parivrtta Upavistha Konasana (poses 14 & 15): 
    The upright, regal nature of the pose requires you to engage your core and spinal muscles. Instead of using gravity and laying your torso down 
    into the pose, you have to work a little harder to lift up and lengthen your spine.
    
    To meet these increased demands, this 16-pose sequence will:
    1) Open your hamstrings and adductors.
    2) Bring your awareness to your core and spinal muscles.
    3) Stretch your side-body, including your lats, obliques, and quadratus lumborum muscles.
    
    Here’s a closer look at the logic of my Compass Pose yoga sequence.
    
    Compass Pose Yoga Sequence
    Poses 1-3
    : These three versions of Down Dog will help you settle into your practice and begin opening your body for Compass pose. The one-legged 
    variation of Down Dog will accentuate the stretch in your bottom leg, while the one-legged variation with the twist will provide your 
    first side-bend of the sequence. Feel free to lean back—almost like you’re going to “flip your dog”—and indulge the stretch in your 
    side-body. Stay for as many breaths in these 3 poses as you like.
    
    Poses 4-5
    : These postures focus on keeping your spine long and stretching your hamstrings. This will prepare your body for the deeper forward bends 
    and side-bends which come later in the sequence. Hold each pose for 5-6 breaths.
    
    Poses 6-10
    : This sequence of standing poses progressively amplifies the demand in your hamstrings, adductors and side-body. These postures flow together 
    nicely and become progressively more demanding. If Bird of Paradise is inaccessible, feel free to skip it or simply practice the pose and keep 
    your top knee bent. Take 3-5 breaths in each pose.
    
    Pose 11
    : Now that your body is warm, it’s time to open your side-body more deeply and approximate the shape of Compass. Parighasana is the perfect 
    pose for the job. 
    
    Take at least 5 breaths here and allow your body to open up.
    
    Poses 12-13
    : These two postures do more than open your hamstrings and adductors. They prepare you for Compass by requiring you to use your core 
    and spinal muscles to lengthen up through your spine. You’ll need to sit tall in Compass. These two postures set the tone for Compass’ 
    upright nature perfectly. Take 3-5 breaths in each pose.
    
    Poses 14-16
    : I teach this progression of side-bends all the time. It feels like a classic combination of lengthening the spine, reaching through 
    the side body and releasing deeply held tension in the inner-legs and lower back. The three postures become progressively more demanding. 
    If you’re body is not ready for Compass, take a step back and content yourself to work with poses 14 and 15. Stay until your heart is 
    content in each of these poses and breath into your tight spots.]],

    When the trainees look at the two poses side-by-side, they see something they usually haven’t noticed before: Bakasana and Tittibhasana 
    (Firefly Pose) are nearly the exact same pose. However, the one major difference between the two postures has significant sequencing 
    implications. We’ll get to the yoga sequencing implications in a moment. But first, let’s look at the similarities between the two poses. 
    
    Take a moment to compare Bakasana and Tittibhasana (Firefly Pose) below.
    
    Bakasana and Titthibhasana share the following similarities:
    
    1. Both poses flex the spine.
    2. Both poses broaden the scapulae while strongly engaging the serratus anterior.
    3. Both poses require strong core engagement, most significantly the transverse abdominus, the rectus abdominus, and the illio-psoas.
    4. The shoulder joint (or gleno-humeral joint for you fact-checkers out there) is at approximately 90 degrees of flexion in both poses.
    5. Both poses strongly flex the hip joints and require the adductors (inner thigh muscles) to engage to prevent the legs from sliding 
    down the arms.
    
    In simple terms, the arms, shoulders, shoulder blades, spine, core, and hips are doing the same thing in Bakasana and Tittibhasana.
    
    The one significant difference between the two poses is that the legs are bent in Bakasana and they’re straight in Tittibhasana. 
    That’s all folks.
    
    But—and this is a big BUT—straightening the legs has far-reaching implications that makes sequencing for Tittibhasana different than 
    sequencing for Bakasana. When you straighten your knees in Tittibhasana (Firefly Pose) you:
    
    1. Stretch your hamstrings. The hamstrings are contracting in Bakasana, but they’re stretching in Tittibhasana. This means your students 
    need plenty of hamstring preparations in the sequence that you create.
    
    2. Stretch and contract your adductor muscles. Tittibhasana requires you to stretch the adductors since the legs open at a slight angle 
    when you straighten the knees in this pose. At the same time, the pose requires you to engage your adductors so that your legs don’t slide 
    down your arms. To facilitate this, your sequencing needs to include both adductor opening and strengthening.
    
    3. Engage your core (even more). If your hamstrings and adductors are the least bit tight, they will pull the weight of your body down as 
    soon as you start straightening your legs. To counteract this downward pull, you have to fire up your core and create even greater lift 
    than you do in Bakasana.
    
    4. Engage your quads: Engaging your quads straightens your knees in Tittibhasana (Firefly Pose). Your quads also work with your core to 
    flex your hips and support the weight of your pelvis. Your sequence and your verbal cueing should include postures that help your students 
    tune into these muscles so they know how to engage them once it’s time for Tittibhasana.]],

    I know I’m not alone in my love for Handstand. It’s empowering, strengthening, and fun. Whether you’re working at the wall, in a studio, 
    or trying to do the pose on a paddleboard, the following sequence will help you build a strong, stable Handstand.
    
    Here’s a look at my thought process when putting together the Handstand prep yoga sequence.
    
    I like to include four preparatory stages when teach Handstand:
    1. Connect students to the core
    2. Connect to the hands
    3. Open the shoulders
    4. Set the tone for balancing with standing balances.
    
    Encouraging a connection to deep, rhythmic breath is a given—especially in sequences that include challenging postures.
    
    I hope this practice helps you feel more calm, confident, and strong in Handstand! Please let me know how it goes in the Comments below.
    
    Poses 1-5: Core Connection The first five postures in this sequence will awaken all of your abdominal muscles, pelvic floor, and hip-flexors 
    in preparation for the Handstand that is down the road.
    
    Your core plays two primary roles in Handstand. 
    
    First, your core helps you move the weight of your pelvis as you jump or press into Handstand. Second, your core helps keep your pelvis 
    stacked directly above your ribcage.
    
    Poses 6-8: Shoulder Opening One of the hidden obstacles in Handstand is tight shoulders. If your shoulders are tight (specifically, ball 
    and socket flexion and scapular lateral rotation), it will difficult to establish a vertical plum line. If your body is not well aligned 
    from top to bottom, all of your muscles will have to work even harder to maintain the pose. By practicing these shoulder openers, you will 
    release restrictions and prepare your shoulders for the demands of Handstand.
    
    Pose 9: Connecting to Your Hands Your hands are the single most important component of balancing in Handstand. You have to learn to be mindful 
    of and responsive with your hands in the pose. Down Dog is included in this sequence to provide you the opportunity to focus on your hands and 
    fingers. By rooting down evenly through your fingertips and the circumference of your palms, you will imprint the work you will need to do with 
    your hands in Handstand.
    
    Poses 10-14: Establishing Balance Balancing in Handstand is hard unless you trained as a gymnast or cheerleader when you were a kid. Sure, 
    it’s doable, but it’s still hard. These standing balances will get you in balancing mode. Allow your body to sway slightly and focus on breathing 
    instead of becoming tense and rigid. Notice all of the activity in your feet, toes, and lower legs. These parts of your body in standing balances 
    are equivalent to your hands, fingers, and forearms in Handstand. 
    
    They have to stay active and responsive to help you maintain balance. I’ve included Triangle Pose in between the other standing balances to provide 
    you with a strong and stable counterpoint.
    
    Poses 15: 
    
    Turn Upside Down Uttanasana provides a calming, grounding posture before you transition into Handstand.
    
    Pose 16: Peak Pose: Handstand (Adho Mukha Vrksasana) For many students, getting into Handstand is more difficult than balancing in the pose. 
    If getting into Handstand remains elusive, be patient and consistent with this sequence. It’s best to work on the pose in the presence of a 
    qualified instructor until you feel confident getting into the pose on your own. In the meantime, this sequence will strengthen and open your 
    body and help you make progress. For those of you who can get into Handstand, practice the posture at the wall and focus on holding the pose 
    for longer increments of time—-ideally building up to one minute in the pose before working on balancing in the middle of the room. Good luck!]],

    In order to prepare your body for Vasisthasana, you need to open your hamstrings, adductors (inner leg muscles) and outer-hips. It’s also a 
    good idea to awaken your core and learn how to work your shoulders safely in the posture.
    
    Here’s a quick step-by-step guide to the peak pose sequence above:
    
    Poses 1-2: Honestly, I love to start practice on my back—especially when I’m going to tackle demanding postures later on. Supta Padangusthasana 
    is the perfect way to settle in, slow down, and open the hamstrings and adductors.
    
    Poses 2-5: I don’t LOVE core work—only masochists and narcissists, do (right?). But, honestly, I can’t avoid it any longer (I’m past 40 and 
    I’ve gotta push back a little harder than when I was 20). These three poses will strengthen your center and warm up your body in no time. They 
    also provide an “energetic” bridge between mellowing out in Supta Padangusthasana and getting things moving in the standing poses that follow.
    
    Poses 6-10: Down Dog warms up the shoulders, lengthens the spine, and opens the back of the legs. When I’m focusing on Vasisthasana, I emphasize 
    broadening my scapulae, firming the outer edges of my scapulae against the ribs (by engaging my serratus anterior muscles) and externally rotating 
    my upper arms. All of these actions are essential for Vashistasana, too. Pigeon, Gecko, Uttanasana, and Prasarita Padottanasana open the hips, 
    hamstrings, and inner legs.
    
    Poses 11-14: In addition to opening the legs and hips, this combination of standing poses brings attention to the back leg. The back leg in standing 
    poses is similar to the bottom leg in Vasisthasana. It has to be strong and stable in order to support the opening of the top leg. These poses remind 
    me to stay focused on how my entire body works together in all postures.
    
    Pose 15: Utthita Hasta Padangusthasana is a standing version of Vasisthasana. Think of them as the same pose with different relationships to gravity. 
    I don’t have an illustration of the leg out to the side—but, be sure to take this version of the pose as well. This is a great opportunity to stay 
    connected to your breath as you practice balancing. It’s going to be even harder to stay connected to your breath in Vasisthasana, so you might as 
    well get started now!
    
    Pose 16: My hamstrings and adductors are relatively tight, so Vasisthasana is still challenging for me. It’s accessible, but it rarely feels graceful! 
    That said, I’m always content after I’ve worked on this pose. If this variation is too much, please feel free to do the posture with your legs stacked 
    or your top leg in Tree Pose.]],

    This sequence focuses on stretching the muscles around the whole circumference of the hip joint. It’s great for relieving tension that

    the end of a long, intense day. Spend 5-10 breaths in each pose (or longer if you’d like) and do both sides before moving to the next pose.
    
    You’ll notice that the sequence ends with Lotus Pose. Lotus is a beautiful pose and one that many of us pine for. But I promise you that 
    doing Lotus does not make you a better person or a better yogi and, if you force your way into the pose, you will feel physically terrible 
    afterward. Surely this is not your goal after asana practice! My point is, if you are naturally very open or are familiar with the pose, 
    feel free to finish with Lotus. If not, then it’s just as valuable to end in Ardha Padmasana (Half Lotus) or with your legs crossed in 
    Sukhasana (Easy Pose) and your attention drawn inward. (And for more hip opening, here’s a full sequence that specifically focuses on

    Surya Namaskar, or Sun Salutations, are the quintessential yoga warm-up sequence. They combine deep breathing with flowing movement, they 
    stretch the entire front and back of the body, and they build strength, too.
    
    There are several variations of Sun Salutations; we thought we’d start with the most basic, which is version “A” in the yoga canon, or 
    Sun Salutation A.

    Sun Salutation A: How To 
    Before you begin, spend a few breaths in Tadasana (Mountain Pose). Notice how your feet feel in contact with the earth — is there more 
    weight on one foot than other? On the front of the foot or the back? Continue to scan your attention all the way up the body, observing 
    the sensations that arise.
    
    Let this inward drawn attention help you start to deepen your breath. Do a total of five rounds of Sun Salutations, syncing each movement 
    to your breath and staying in Downward-Dog for five breaths.
    
    On days when you don’t have time for a long practice, this powerful package of poses can quiet your mind while boosting your energy and 
    give you just the amount of stretch and activation you need to have a calm, productive day.

    For all Sun Salutations, it’s essential that you breathe in and out through your nose and elongate your breath. Try to imagine that your breath 
    leads the movement; it’s what compels you to move through each pose. Follow the breath cues below, staying for five full breaths in your third

    There are days when we want to work toward a peak pose, and there are other days when we’re not sure what to do with our bodies. On those 
    days, I always find it’s most helpful to do an all-around balanced, whole body yoga sequence: One that stretches and strengthens all the 
    different regions of the body, that works the front body, back, and side body, and that allows me to turn upside down, even if only for a 
    5-10 breaths.
    
    Not only are these types of whole body yoga sequences physically balancing, they are often incredibly soothing to the nervous system.
    
    To encourage this effect, I invite you to spread your attention evenly throughout your whole body as you do each pose in the yoga sequence 
    below. Instead of focusing on the part of your body that feels the biggest sensation or stretch — which, by the way, can be a very valuable 
    technique for focusing attention during asana practice — try to give all the different parts and pieces of the pose the same amount of attention. 
    Let the shapes of the poses spark genuine curiosity in you — check in to what the back leg is doing in Warrior II or what the fingers are doing 
    in Triangle Pose. By cultivating this type of attention, you’ll create a wonderful sense of soothing equanimity in your attention, in your nervous 
    system, and in your poses.]],

    I’ve spent many an evening, after a long, hard day doing these poses in our living room while family life happens around me. That might mean

    pristine (and yours doesn’t have to be either), but I still find it incredibly helpful to spend a few minutes on self-care in the evening. 
    It provides a buffer zone that helps me relax so that when it’s time for sleep, my mind isn’t buzzing and my body isn’t calling out for more 
    attention.
    
    The evening yoga sequence focuses on stretching the hips, hamstrings, and shoulders – all areas that accumulate tension in daily life. You’ll 
    notice that there are no Sun Salutations at the beginning of the sequence and that’s intentional. The idea is to gently nurture yourself by 
    stretching, breathing, and tuning your awareness to your body and breath. This act of focusing on exactly what you’re doing in your body and 
    breath will help slow down the momentum of your mind so that when it’s time to let go and sleep, it’s easier to do that.

    I love creating sequences for Parsva Bakasana. I always have. Since the posture contains so many components, there are countless ways I can 
    take the class. I can focus on a sequence of upper body and core strengthening postures before tackling Parsva Bakasana. Or, I teach a practice 
    full of deep, detoxifying twists before guiding my students into this peak pose. Other times, like in the sequence below, I’ll create a more 
    balanced approach where each of the posture’s components is equally prepared.
    
    Sequencing for Parsva Bakasana is also deeply satisfying because a sound, logical progression can help students break through and do the posture 
    for the first time. Confusion is one of the biggest hurdles to doing this pose well—-or, at all. Often times students are physically capable to 
    do the pose but struggle because they don’t know the building blocks. A good sequence demystifies the actions and helps you feel your way into 
    the pose.
    
    Since Parsva Bakasana is the foundation for more advanced arm balances such as Dwi Pada Koundinyasana and Eka Pada Koundinyasana I, it’s a 
    nice posture to emphasize in mixed level classes because you can encourage the more seasoned students to work on these variations.
    
    Here are a couple of thoughts about the practice before you begin:
    
    Sequence Focus: Parsva Bakasana requires core strength, upper body strength, hip flexibility, and spinal flexibility. The practice begins 
    with core strengthening postures, then transitions into a progression of twisting standing postures. The standing postures I chose will 
    help open your hips and prepare your spinal muscles for the twisting component of Parsva Bakasana. Finally, the posture hits its’ peak 
    with Bakasana and Parsva Bakasana. If Bakasana is a challenging pose for you, please check out my Bakasana sequence. Take your time, be 
    patient, and enjoy yourself—-even if you struggle a little.
    
    Before You Begin: For a longer, more intense practice, you can begin with Sun Salutations. Feel free to include as many lunge salutations, 
    Surya Namaksar A, and Surya Namaskar B as you’d like. Otherwise, you can dive into the practice below.
    
    After You Finish: This sequence is predominantly twists. 
    
    Twists prepare the body for forward bends and backbends, so, really, you can go either way after you’ve concluded Parsva Bakasana. If you 
    want to do forward bends, Baddha Konasana (Bound Angle Pose), Upavistha Konasana (Wide Angle Pose), and Paschimottanasana (Seated Forward Bend) 
    are a good bet. If you want to do backbends, I recommend a Low Lunge to open the front of your thigh before transitioning into a few rounds of 
    Setu Bandha (Bridge Pose) and Urdvha Dhanurasana (Upward Bow Pose).

    This sequence is invaluable to have in your back pocket during the winter months. It’s not a high-intensity practice – it’s a healing, 
    nurturing, immune boosting yoga practice. The poses encourage relaxation, reduce stress, and facilitate circulation throughout your whole 
    body. These are the three most effective things that yoga asana can do to help support your immune system.
    
    Yoga for the Immune System
    You’ll start off on your back in a Supta Padangusthasana series, which requires very little exertion for those of you feeling fatigued. 
    From there, you’ll gently open your hips, where stress and tension often pool. Then you’ll move into forward bends, which facilitate quiet, 
    inward-drawn attention. You’ll finish with some rejuvenating yoga inversions that reverse blood flow and open the neck and shoulders. 
    (Sometimes they even relieve sinus congestion, although too much inverting can make it worse, so listen to your body.)
    
    As you move through the practice, give yourself permission to slow down and settle in to your body and breath. Try to be as gentle and patient 
    with yourself as possible – especially if you have a cold when frustration and impatience can rear its head. These qualities—going slowly, 
    nurturing yourself, taking your time—are your own natural antidotes to stress, depletion, and fatigue. I hope this sequence helps you tap into 
    them and have a healthy winter season!]],

    Lotus Pose (Padmasana) is one you were likely familiar with before you ever set foot in a yoga studio. Surely you’d seen sculptures of 
    Siddartha or photographs of Indian sadhus with their legs tightly folded together in a pretzel shape. It’s a pose that’s associated with 
    serene states of meditation — and the shape of the pose really does encourage quiet.
    
    Perhaps the tranquil look of the pose is what makes us all pine for it. But make no mistake — it’s not to be attempted lightly. It requires 
    an enormous amount of flexibility in the hip joint and if your body just doesn’t “go there,” you risk hurting your knees.
    
    In the meantime, you can get many benefits with a sequence that prepares you for Lotus. And if your body is ready to fold into the pose, 
    you will know. (Trust me on this.) There will be no knee pain, no stress, no sense of prying or leveraging or forcing. Instead, it will 
    feel like you are folding yourself into the pose.
    
    Forcing your body into Lotus Pose is not worth it in the long run. Pain in your knees or your hips is a sign to back off. Got it? Good.
    
    Most students make the same mistake when they open their hips for Lotus Pose: They focus on stretching the outer hips but forget to open 
    the other muscle groups that make up the hip joint. While the outer hips usually need plenty of help, the key to freedom and balance in 
    your hips is working with all the muscle groups that affect the joint, not just your external rotators. I can’t promise you a Lotus, but 
    practicing the following sequence will make your hips be happier, healthier, and more supple as you work toward it.
    
    If you want to make this sequence a stronger, sweatier flow practice, feel free to practice several Sun Salutations first. You can also 
    add standing poses, arm balances, and inversions to increase the intensity of this practice.
    
    If you’re in need of a quieter, more contemplative practice, you can finish with seated meditation or pranayama.
    
    Hold each pose in the sequence for at least 5 breaths and be sure to practice both sides before attempting Lotus Pose.]],

    Do you remember sliding easily into Hanumanasana (which you likely called “the splits”) when you were a kid? If you don’t, not to worry — I 
    don’t either! It’s a pose that can still give me a challenge depending on the day, but over many years of practice, I’ve learned to find a safe, 
    comfortable, and exhilarating place for my body to land.
    
    When you first attempt Hanumanasana, you might focus a lot on your front leg and how tight it feels. You might think you need to spend 
    exorbitant amounts of time stretching, stretching, stretching your hamstrings. But Hanumansana requires flexibility in both the front 
    and back legs. The front leg requires hamstring suppleness, and the back leg requires openness in the hip flexors. When you can find a 
    balance stretched between the front and back legs in Hanumanasana, you’ll find a balanced pose.
    
    I always tell students that it doesn’t matter if your pelvis touches the floor in this pose — in fact, it doesn’t matter if your pelvis 
    is miles away from the floor! Instead of jamming your body toward the floor (a recipe for back pain and other miseries), try to find a 
    level pelvis, where you’re not tucking or overarching your lower back. Support yourself with props as you do this — you can stack blocks 
    or a bolster or couch cushions underneath your pelvis for support. And don’t forget to use your leg muscles to support your endeavor — hug 
    the inner thighs in toward each other and press your legs down into the floor to help you lift the pelvis and engage your hamstrings. 
    It may seem counterintuitive to use your muscles while you’re stretching, but it will help keep your joints and the pose more supported.
    
    Have fun and think of embodying the spirit of the pose’s namesake, the Hindu monkey God Hanuman as you lift your arms and breathe deeply 
    in the pose.

    Urdhva Dhanurasana, aka Upward-Bow or Wheel Pose or simply “Backbend,” is an iconic pose in the yoga canon. Visually it represents the 
    acrobatic flexibility that so many of us long for when we first begin the yoga practice. But too often the feeling of the pose doesn’t 
    match that open, soaring look.
    
    My first piece of advice when practicing Urdhva Dhanurasana is to focus on creating even sensations throughout your whole body when you 
    do the pose. Instead of focusing on going deep, focus on creating evenness. When you practice this way, not only will the pose feel a 
    whole lot better, you’ll be more apt to open the places that need it and derive the overall benefits of backbending! (An added benefit 
    is that you potentially head off injuries because you’re not pushing past your edge).
    
    This month’s sequence prepares you for Wheel Pose by opening the shoulders and upper back as well as the front sheath of the body — 
    specifically the quadriceps and hip flexors. It also builds heat in the whole body. All of this should help you feel more ease, more 
    space, more joy in your backbend.
    
    There’s so much more to say about sequencing for backbends. If you want to find out more, I encourage you to check out my e-course, 
    The Art of Yoga Sequencing. And, as always, please sign up for my mailing list if you want to get a monthly reminder when new sequences

    Step 1
    Start on your hands and knees in a table top position with your hands and knees shoulder width apart. Your hands should be slightly in 
    front of your shoulders. Spread your fingers wide on your mat with your middle fingers facing forward. Firmly press your palms flat on 
    your mat.
    
    Step 2
    Curl your toes under. Exhale slowly as you lift your knees off of the floor and send your hips skyward. 
    
    Press your chest back toward your thighs.
    
    Step 3
    Move toward straightening your legs and lowering your heels, but don’t lock out your knees or try to force it.
    
    Step 4
    Tilt your sitting bones up high and rotate your inner thighs slightly in and up, aware of your low ribs’ tendency to jut out as you find 
    length here. Draw the ribs gently back in by toning your belly.
    
    Step 5
    Press the pads of your fingers and your full palm into the floor. Straighten but don’t lock out your arms. Engage your upper arm muscles 
    to draw your elbows slightly in and pull your shoulders out of your ears.
    
    Step 6
    Keep your neck neutral (ears aligned with biceps) with your your gaze looking slightly back toward your feet.
    
    -------------------------
    
    Step 1 
    Come onto the floor on your hands and knees. Set your knees directly below your hips and your hands slightly forward of your shoulders. 
    Spread your palms, index fingers parallel or slightly turned out, and turn your toes under.
    
    Step 2 
    Exhale and lift your knees away from the floor. At first keep the knees slightly bent and the heels lifted away from the floor. Lengthen 
    your tailbone away from the back of your pelvis and press it lightly toward the pubis. Against this resistance, lift the sitting bones 
    toward the ceiling, and from your inner ankles draw the inner legs up into the groins.
    
    Step 3 
    Then with an exhalation, push your top thighs back and stretch your heels onto or down toward the floor. Straighten your knees but be sure 
    not to lock them. Firm the outer thighs and roll the upper thighs inward slightly. Narrow the front of the pelvis.
    
    Step 4 
    Firm the outer arms and press the bases of the index fingers actively into the floor. From these two points lift along your inner arms from 
    the wrists to the tops of the shoulders. Firm your shoulder blades against your back, then widen them and draw them toward the tailbone. Keep 
    the head between the upper arms; don't let it hang.
    
    Step 5 
    Adho Mukha Svanasana is one of the poses in the traditional Sun Salutation sequence. It's also an excellent yoga asana all on its own. Stay 
    in this pose anywhere from 1 to 3 minutes. Then bend your knees to the floor with an exhalation and rest in Child's Pose.]],

    Do you know Mountain Pose? Flip it upside down and you have Handstand. Go ahead, try.
    
    Like its inverted cousins such as Forearm Balance and Headstand, a major obstacle to Handstand is a natural fear of falling. So the basic 
    pose will be described with the heels supported against a wall. Make sure that there are no hanging pictures or other decorations on the 
    wall directly above you.]],
    benefits=[[

    goodFor={},
    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Perform Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog Pose) with your fingertips an inch or two away from a wall, hands shoulder-width. If 
    your shoulders are tight, turn your index fingers out slightly; otherwise arrange them parallel to each other. If you're uneasy about 
    this pose, you're not alone. To ready yourself for and secure yourself in this inversion, firm your shoulder blades against your back 
    torso and pull them toward your tailbone. Then rotate your upper arms outward, to keep the shoulder blades broad, and hug your outer 
    arms inward. Finally spread your palms and press the bases of the index fingers firmly against the floor.
    
    Step 2
    Now bend one knee and step the foot in, closer to the wall (we'll say it's the left leg), but keep the other (i.e. right) leg active by 
    extending through the heel. Then take a few practice hops before you try to launch yourself upside down. Sweep your right leg through a 
    wide arc toward the wall and kick your left foot off the floor, immediately pushing through the heel to straighten the left knee. As both 
    legs come off the ground, engage your deep core abdominal muscles to help lift your hips over your shoulders. Hop up and down like this 
    several times, each time pushing off the floor a little higher. Exhale deeply each time you hop.
    
    Step 3
    Hopping up and down like this may be all you can manage for now. Regularly practice strengthening poses, like Adho Mukha Svanasana and 
    Plank Pose. Eventually you'll be able to kick all the way into the pose. At first your heels may crash into the wall, but again with more 
    practice you'll be able to swing your heels up lightly to the wall.
    
    Step 4
    If your armpits and groins are tight, your lower back may be deeply arched. To lengthen this area, draw your front ribs into your torso, 
    reach your tailbone toward your heels, and slide your heels higher up the wall. Squeeze the outer legs together and roll the thighs in. 
    Hang your head from a spot between your shoulder blades and gaze out into the center of the room.
    
    Step 5
    To start stay in the pose 10 to 15 seconds, breathing deeply. Gradually work your way up to 1 minute. When you come down, be sure not to 
    sink onto the shoulders. Keep your shoulder blades lifted and broad, and take one foot down at a time, each time with an exhalation. 
    Stand in Uttanasana for 30 seconds to 1 minute. We tend to kick up with the same leg all the time: be sure to alternate your kicking leg, 
    one day right, next day left.]],

    One way to modify Handstand is to brace the crown of your head against a padded support placed on the floor between your hands. A 
    supported head stabilizes your position and is a great confidence booster. But getting exactly the right height can be tricky: if the height 
    is too low, your head won’t be braced; if it’s too high, your neck will get scrunched. Use a yoga block for a base, then pile two or more 
    folded blankets (or a bolster) on top. How high you build the support will depend on the height and the length of your arms. Experiment with 
    different heights until you feel like you have the right one, then position your hands on the floor to either side of it. Walk in from Adho 
    Mukha Svanasana until you can brace your crown on the support and the back of your head against the wall. Then follow the instructions above 
    for moving into the pose.]],
    deepen=[[
    Lifting the head to look at the floor is an advanced movement. Be sure not to jam the base of your skull into the back of your neck. Imagine 
    as you lift your head that someone is holding a softball against the nape of your neck. This will help maintain the cervical curve. Also, to 
    lift your head, initiate the movement by pressing your shoulder blades more deeply into your back. 
    
    Brace your crown against the wall. Then take one heel away from the wall and strongly extend it toward the ceiling. Bring that heel back to the 
    wall and do the same with other. Finally try to take both heels off the wall and balance with only your crown against the wall.]],
    tips=[[
    Many beginners find it difficult to keep their elbows straight in this pose. Buckle a strap and loop it over your upper arms, just 
    above your elbows. Extend your arms straight out in front of you at shoulder width and adjust the strap so that it is snug against 
    your outer arms. Then use the strap in the pose, but think of pushing the arms slightly in, away from the strap, rather than letting 
    them bulge out into the strap.]],
    partnering=[[
    A partner can help you get a feel for the movement of the tailbone. Position her in front of you as you’re in the pose. Have her wrap her 
    arms around your pelvis, gripping one wrist in the opposite hand, and cradle the sacrum. Then she can pull the back of your pelvis up, 
    lifting your tailbone toward your heels.]],
    variations=[[
    You can vary this pose by placing your hands in different positions. For example, you can narrow your hands inside shoulder width, which 
    decreases your base of support and so develops your sense of balance. Or you can turn your hands outward, which will teach you how to 
    externally rotate the upper arms.]]}

    Slide the right hand forward along the right leg and grab the right leg toes with the fingers.
    
    Step 3
    Pull the right leg backwards and raise it toward the right side of the face. Place it near the right ear. Simultaneously, slide the left 
    hand forward to grab the left leg toes.
    
    Step 4
    Pull the right hand as back as possible. Try to keep the head and trunk as straight as possible. This will require some flexibility of the hip, 
    back and shoulders. 
    
    Try to achieve it slowly over few sessions, if you are not able to achieve it on the very first attempt.
    
    Step 5
    In the final pose, the practitioner resembles an archer about to release an arrow from the bow. Hold the breath in this position.

    Remain in this position for as long as you are comfortable.
    
    Step 7
    One may either hold the breath or breath very shallowly in this final position.
    
    Step 8
    To release the pose, bring down the right leg to the floor. Release your grip on both the toes.
    
    Step 9
    Straighten out the legs again. Place both hands on the thighs and breathe normally.

    Stretch your right arm straight out along the floor parallel to your torso so that you create one long line from the heels to your finger

    Step 3
    Externally rotate your left leg so the toes point toward the ceiling, then bend and draw the knee toward your torso. Reach across the inside

    Anjali Mudra provides a moment of centering, which is why it is commonly done at the beginning or end of a physical yoga practice. You can do 
    Anjali Mudra yourself by adding it to your existing routine. Just taking a moment of intentionality at the beginning or end. Really utilize 
    the moment to honor or connect with something great.

    wellness practice that has wide benefits in reducing stress, promoting calmness, heightening focus, and transcending unhelpful mental patterns.]],

    Slow down the fluctuations of your mind
    Guide light and love towards someone in your life
    Simply a moment to reconnect with yourself (your wants, needs, and feelings)

    correctly the spleen is automatically corrected. Gastric problems and constipation are also alleviated with this asana.

    Step 1 
    
    Many people find it useful to warm up the hips first by cradling one leg to the chest. Hold the knee and foot and press them together, or 
    if you have the ability, take the foot and knee in the crook of your elbows and interlace your fingers. Then work into the hip joint by 
    moving your bent leg slowly from side to side.
    
    Step 2
    
    Sit on the floor with both legs extended in seated staff posture. Bend the left knee as in the warm up position. To bring the leg into half 
    lotus pose, hold the left foot in close to the navel and let the left knee move forward as it comes down toward the earth (there is a sense 
    of rolling the ball of the thighbone in the hip socket while you square the hips to the front).
    
    Step 3
    
    Bring the outer ankle to the very top of the right thigh. If the outer edge of the left foot is all that reaches the thigh you risk 
    overstretching the ligaments, it is best to work on hip opening poses to build toward this pose at a later stage.
    
    Step 4
    
    On an exhalation, twist the torso to the left, rotate the left shoulder inward, and reach the left forearm behind the waist to grasp the 
    toes of the left foot with the fingers of left hand.

    Create length in your spine before folding the upper body forward from the hips, bringing the chest toward the right thigh and clasping the 
    right foot with the right hand. Asked the big toe of the left foot with the thumb and forefinger of the left hand.

    A bound half-lotus pose balancing on one leg with a forward fold…what could possibly go wrong?!
    
    Despite its position early on in the Ashtanga yoga standing sequence, Ardha Baddha Padmottanasana is a tricky little posture.]],
    benefits=[[
    Flexible Hips & Knee Joints
    
    While doing this asana, you are required to stand for a reasonable period of time. Besides, the various steps of Half Bound Lotus Pose 
    ensure ample stretching of your hips, hamstrings, shoulders, and knees. This eventually results in extremely flexible hips and knee 
    joints and rather stronger legs.
    
    Stronger Spine
    When you stand still on one leg or bend completely to perform this yoga pose, a lot of pressure gets created on the back and shoulder 
    region. This movement allows more flexibility to the spine and makes it stronger and less prone to injury.
    
    Better Digestion
    As you bend forward, the internal organs of the stomach get contracted and result in a better supply of oxygenated blood. Besides, the 
    movement also helps in cleansing the liver and spleen, which further improves your digestive system.
    
    Better Lungs
    When you put the arm behind the back, the shoulder joint starts getting better blood supply. This leads to the expansion of the chest 
    that further enhances your respiratory qualities.
    
    Relaxed Mind
    This challenging yoga asana tests your ability to remain alert and stay calm throughout. The way you try to achieve a balance while 
    doing this asana actually enhances the capacity of your mind to concentrate. With an improved focus, you feel more relaxed.]],

    steps=[[
    Step 1
    First of all, stand in the Mountain Pose (Tadasana) by keeping both the arms at the sides.
    
    Step 2
    Now, shift your body weight onto the left foot and ground down firmly.
    
    Step 3
    Try to move the right knee slowly up towards the chest. Then raise your right foot and put the right heel to rest on the front of the left 
    thigh, a little higher. Make sure that the sole of your foot is facing upward and the upper face of the foot is resting on the leg comfortably.
    
    Step 4
    Now, you can even let the right knee to drop down and get parallel to the knee of the left leg.
    
    Step 5
    Do remember to keep your gaze focused on one particular spot on the ground, about four feet in front of the place where you are standing. 
    This will complete your Half Lotus Tree Pose (Ardha Padmasana Vrksasana).
    
    Step 6
    Then, hold the right foot with the left hand. Try to draw both the hips forward in order to lengthen your spine. Inhale slowly and take 
    your right arm towards the sky. By reaching from behind the back, take hold of the left elbow and then clasp the right toes with your right hand.
    
    Step 7
    Further, take a deep breath and try to lift the left arm straight up. Then exhale and fold forward gradually from the hips. Now, you must 
    place the left hand firmly on the ground. Draw the chin towards your chest and try to bring the forehead closer to the shin.
    
    Step 8
    Stay in this pose for five to six breaths and then press down the left foot firmly on the ground in order to lift the torso in an upright 
    position. Then, unbind the right arm gently. Put the right foot on the floor. Get into the Mountain Pose once again before you repeat this

    the engagement of the muscles helps to draw you deeper.

    Balance is always tricky in this pose for beginners. A wall is a useful prop, which you can use in one of two ways. Stand with your back to 
    the wall, one leg's length away from the wall. Exhale and bend forward into a standing forward bend, then inhale and raise your left leg parallel 
    to the floor and press the left sole against the wall. Start with your toes turned toward the floor. Exhale again and rotate your torso to the left; 
    at the same time, turn the left leg and foot until the inner foot is parallel to the floor. Rest your left hand on the left hip. The pressure of

    may seem sweet and demure with flower arrows and a sugarcane bow, her weapons become sharp and deadly when demons need slaying. All yogis can 
    relate to this need for inner dichotomy:
    There are times to be pleasant and agreeable, and times to stand with ferocity and fight for what is right and moral.]],

    Step 1 Parsvakonasana (Extended Side Angle Pose)
    Come back into Parsvakonasana (Extended Side Angle Pose) on the left side. Place your right hand on your right hip and look down to the 
    floor. Inhale deeply; step your right foot forward (about 6 inches) and walk your left hand diagonally out to the left of your front foot 
    (about 10 inches).
    
    Step 2 Ardha Chandrasana (Half Moon Pose)
    Spring off your right foot while grounding your left foot into the floor for balance. Lift your right leg up behind you on a diagonal into 
    Ardha Chandrasana (Half Moon Pose). Be sure your right leg is in line with your torso, so you don’t overwork your outer hip or inner thigh 
    muscles. Keep your standing leg engaged by lifting the muscles above your kneecap. Bring your right arm up vertically and slowly take your 
    gaze to your top hand. If you feel cramping in your standing leg, draw the left buttock under to elongate the glute muscle.
    
    Step 3: Bend Knee Toward Chest
    Once you feel steady, bring your right knee toward your chest so you can grab the top of your right foot with your right hand. 
    
    Step 4: Ardha Chandra Chapasana
    When your hand has made a connection with the top of your right foot, hold firmly and swing your knee back behind you. To fully open the pose, 
    kick your right foot into your hand as though you’re trying to straighten your leg. Without letting your right hip pop forward, draw your left 
    buttock under. Be sure your bent (right) thigh stays in line with your torso, so that you do not overwork your outer or inner thigh muscles. 
    Hold here for 3–5 breaths. To come out, release your foot and place your right hand on your hip; bend your standing leg; powerfully reach 
    through your back leg, and place your right foot on the floor, returning to Parsvakonasana. Repeat on the other side.]],

    One of the underlying benefits of practicing ardha hanumanasana is its ability to teach proper muscular engagement. Because hanumanasana 
    can be so intense (or so easy), it is often practiced poorly when it comes to alignment and physical engagement. While working in ardha 
    hanumanasana, pay attention to your muscles, especially around the pelvis. Rather than collapsing into the joints–which puts muscles and 
    joints at risk–learn to be active rather than passive. Focusing on the right muscular actions can relieve discomfort around the inner knees, 
    the SI joints, and hamstring attachments.]],

    Sit on the floor with your legs straight out in front of you, buttocks supported on a folded blanket. Bend your knees, put your feet on the 
    floor, then slide your left foot under your right leg to the outside of your right hip. Lay the outside of the left leg on the floor. Step 
    the right foot over the left leg and stand it on the floor outside your left hip. The right knee will point directly up at the ceiling.
    
    Step 2
    
    Exhale and twist toward the inside of the right thigh. Press the right hand against the floor just behind your right buttock, and set your 
    left upper arm on the outside of your right thigh near the knee. Pull your front torso and inner right thigh snugly together.

    Extend your left arm toward your partner, pressing the back of your arm against the top of the right thigh. Your partner can grip your wrist 
    and, at the same time, press his/her feet against the outside of your right thigh. Gently pushing with the feet and pulling with the hands, 
    your partner can draw the left side of your torso out of the inner left groin while you slide the back arm further along and tuck your left

    Half Lotus Pose is a seated posture that opens the hips and stretches the knees and ankles. It is a variation of the traditional seated 
    meditation posture, Lotus Pose (Padmasana), that is more suitable for students with less flexibility in the lower body.
    
    The Sanskrit name for this pose, ""Ardha Padmasana"" (ARD-uh pahd-MAHS-uh-nuh), comes from three words:
    
    As with other seated poses, such as Easy Pose (Sukhasana) and Perfect Pose (Siddhasana), Half Lotus is traditionally used for long periods 
    of meditation and breathing exercises (called ""pranayama"" in Sanskrit). The soothing effects of this pose can allow for greater awareness 
    of your mind, body, and spirit — which can spill over into your everyday life. You may discover that practicing this pose brings you peace, 
    even outside of your yoga class.
    
    While this variation is usually easier than the full version of the pose, it is not recommended for absolute beginners, as the depth of 
    flexibility required may be too demanding]],
    benefits=[[
    Half Lotus strengthens the back.

    Avoid practicing this pose if you have a recent or chronic injury to the knees, ankles, or hips. If your hips, knees, or ankles are very

    Since this pose is often used for long periods of seated meditation, it's important to feel comfortable in Half Lotus Pose. Be sure to make 
    whatever modifications you need to feel steady and supported in the pose. Here are a few suggestions:
    
    - If the knee of your top leg doesn't rest on the floor, support it with a folded, firm blanket.
    
    - For more back support, sit with your back against a wall. For even more support for your upper back, place a yoga block between the wall 
    and your shoulder blades. Practice this way until you have built up enough strength to sit away from the wall with your spine straight.
    
    - If you are not yet able to perform Half Lotus, practice Easy Pose (Sukhasana) until you have gained the flexibility and strength to sit 
    comfortably in the pose.
    
    - For those with very tight hips, practice the pose seated in a chair. Leaving one foot flat on the floor, cross the opposite ankle into 
    the hip crease of the grounded foot. Hold the pose for up to one minute, and then repeat on the opposite side.]],

    tips=[[
    Practicing Half Lotus Pose in correct alignment will automatically begin to soothe your thoughts and calm your body. Keep the following 
    information in mind when practicing this pose:
    
    Be sure to change the cross of your legs, not favoring one side or the other. Hold the pose for the same length of time on each side. 
    If you are practicing the pose for an extended period, such as in a meditation or pranayama practice, you have a few options:
    
    a) Set a timer; then change the cross of your legs halfway through your practice.
    b) Practice with a different leg on top each day. This usually works best if you practice the pose every day.
    c) If you practice the pose at the beginning and end of your practice, start with the opposite leg position at the end than the one you 
    used at the beginning.
    
    Take it slowly.
    
    Keep your breath smooth and even throughout the pose.
    
    If you feel any pinching or jarring pain (particularly in your knees), immediately back out of the pose.
    
    Never attempt to force your body beyond its current level of capability just to achieve a pose! When your hips and legs become more open, 
    then attempt full Lotus Pose.]]}

    sequence. You are prone with your back arched and chin, chest, hands, knees, and feet touching the mat. It's a great way for beginners to 
    work on building the arm strength needed for Chaturanga Dandasana. It also acts as a warm-up for the backbends you'll likely get to later 
    in your practice session. In the sun salutations, it is the sixth pose. This pose has a lot to offer more advanced yoga students as well.]],
    benefits=[[
    This pose improves the mobility of the back and increases arm strength while opening up the chest. It is like a half push-up, so it helps 
    build the muscles necessary to do Chaturanga safely. This pose prepares you for other poses requiring arm-balancing. In daily life, you 
    may need to get into and out of this prone position and the pose will strengthen you for that task.
    
    This pose is also known as the Salute with Eight Limbs. In Sanskrit, ashta means eight and anga means part while namaskara means salutation. 
    This name comes from the body touching the ground in eight locations during the pose. You touch the ground with your feet, knees, palms,

    Picture Step 1 - Carry your leg like a handbag!
    Grab your foot, and place your leg behind your arm. You want to bring the leg the closest you can to your shoulder, or even on top of the 
    shoulder if you can, as this will help to keep the leg in place. Press the arm and leg firmly into each other.
    
    If your leg slides off you will struggle for the next steps. 
    
    It is absolutely ok to work on this first. The more your hips are open, the easier it will be!
    
    Picture Step 2: Hook your feet together!
    
    Your leg is firmly placed on your shoulder, as showed in step 1, and you are now placing your hands shoulder distance apart, fingers wide, 
    pressing your fingertips on the ground.
    
    Lift the foot that has been resting on the ground, and hook your feet together by crossing the ankles. 
    
    Picture Step 3: Lift that bum off the floor!
    
    The leg has not moved, still placed next to or on top of your shoulder. Bring your weight gently forward and lift your bum off the floor. 
    Think balance here, if you bring your weight too much forward, you will fall on your face, and if you don’t bring your weight enough forward, 
    lifting up will be very hard! Play with the shape to find the right placement for your body. 
    
    A little trick here; if you struggle (and feel that your arms are not long enough) place some hard blocks under your hands, it should make 
    it slightly easier. 
    
    Picture Step 4: 
    
    Extend your legs across! 
    
    The last, and probably the trickiest part is coming. Don’t get frustrated if you do not succeed the first time, falling is part of the process.
    
    Keep the leg next to or on top of the shoulder, the bum off the floor, and continue to bring your weight forward as you simultaneously bend 
    your elbows. We are aiming for a 90° angle here, like with chaturanga arms. If you find this part very hard, maybe you need to work more on 
    your upper body strength.
    
    When your upper body is stable, start extending the legs away from you, squeezing the feet and thighs firmly together.
    
    That’s the full pose! Have fun with it, and remember to practice both side. 
    
    =========================
    
    Step 1
    Come off your sticky mat so you can use the floor to slide around. Start out in a comfortable seated pose. 
    
    Inhale to hike the left leg up on the left shoulder. Firmly press the leg into the arm to help fix it there; continue to hug the arm with 
    your leg. (If your leg does not make it onto the shoulder, hold it with both hands at the highest point you can access, and breathe.)
    
    Step 2
    Exhale and plant your hands shoulder-width apart on either side of your hips. Keep the pressure of the left leg on your shoulder and inhale 
    to cross the right foot over the left, hooking the ankles around each other. Your leg will likely slip off your shoulder—just make sure it 
    sticks to your arm.
    
    Step 3
    Press into your hands and exhale to slide your hips back along the floor and come into a gentle face plant. On an inhalation, look forward 
    and lift both shoulders away from the floor, as you did in Chaturanga, eventually lifting your shoulders in line with your elbows.
    
    Step 4
    Keeping your shoulders fixed in this position as best you can, exhale to press your top leg down onto your arm to lift your hips. Kick your 
    heels forward to straighten your legs as you squeeze your left arm with both thighs (think ThighMaster!). If you squeeze the inner thighs 
    powerfully, these actions alone should float you into the pose. (Note that the bottom leg tends to lag, so squeeze it firmly against the 
    upper arm.) It’s OK if the weight of the legs pushes the shoulders down—just actively move the shoulders back enough to prevent them from 
    getting overpowered. Breathe here for 3 full, deep breaths, and then bend your knees to help you lower back down. Repeat on the right side.]],

    Hand Placement
    Don't place your hands too close to your hips. They need to be about a foot in front of your hips so you can bend your elbows and lift your hips.
    
    Elbow Position
    If your outer elbow isn't close to your ribs your outer shoulder will drop too low and you will have increased pressure on it.
    
    ------------------------
    
    While Astavakrasana is a powerful upper-back strengthener, it’s important to have built up enough core and upper-back strength before 
    trying it so that when you push up you are not dumping all of your weight into the weaker, more peripheral parts of your shoulder joints, 
    elbows, and wrists. To avoid injury to these areas, take your time over weeks or even months to do Chaturanga Dandasana with good alignment, 
    which will get your upper back and core in shape to bear weight safely in this peak pose.]]}

    Begin in Mountain Pose (Tadasana). Turn to the left and extend your arms sideways to shoulder-height, palms facing down. Step your feet as

    Step 2
    Turn your right foot outward 90 degrees so your toes point to the top of your mat. Bend your right knee until your right thigh is parallel 
    to the floor (you may need to widen your stance). Keep your right knee directly over your heel. Turn in your left toes slightly and align 
    the heel of your right foot with the arch of your left foot.

    Do not practice this pose if you are currently experiencing headaches, insomnia, or high or low blood pressure. If you have a neck injury 
    or current neck pain, do not turn your head upward in the pose. Instead, keep your gaze straight ahead with both sides of your neck evenly

    Baddha Utthita Parsvakonasana is already a challenging variation on the standard pose! If you can’t yet clasp your wrist in the full bind, 
    hold onto a yoga strap with each hand. For a greater challenge as you gain flexibility, draw your top shoulder back even further so it stacks 
    directly over your front thigh. 
    
    Keep the alignment of your feet, knees, and legs as you turn your chest up toward the ceiling.]],
    tips=[[
    Bound Side Angle Pose will deeply stretch the entire body when practiced in correct alignment. Keep the following information in mind when 
    practicing this pose:
    
    Since Side Angle Pose is the foundation for Bound Side Angle Pose, it’s important to get the alignment correct in Side Angle Pose first. 
    Thoroughly review the information in the iSport guide How to Do Extended Side Angle Pose in Yoga before trying this variation!
    Keep your spine long throughout the pose. Lengthen from the tailbone to the crown of your head.
    Engage your abdomen, drawing your belly in. This will help to stabilize the pose from your core.
    Do not allow your top shoulder to drop forward in the pose. Lift your chest and broaden across your collar bones.
    Keep the outer edge of your back foot pressing firmly into the mat. Try to ensure that your back baby toe is on the mat.
    Keep your front knee aligned with your front ankle. Do not allow the knee to drift inward — this can strain the knee joint. Instead, 
    imagine it slightly moving out toward the baby toe.
    
    Open Wide
    
    Baddha Utthita Parsvakonasana will take your practice to a new level. 
    
    Breathe smoothly and evenly through the pose. Remember that the ultimate “goal” of yoga is not the pose itself but your awareness of the 
    pose. Keep your breath steady and your mind will follow. 
    
    Practicing a challenging pose with a calm mind will open up new paths along your yoga journey!]]}

    steps=[[
    Step 1 Squat down from Tadasana with your inner feet a few inches apart. If it isn't possible to keep your heels on the floor, support them 
    on a thickly folded blanket. Separate your knees wider than your hips and lean the torso forward, between the inner thighs. Stretch your 
    arms forward, then bend your elbows, place your hands on the floor and the backs of the upper arms against the shins.
    
    Step 2 Snuggle your inner thighs against the sides of your torso, and your shins into your armpits, and slide the upper arms down as low 
    onto the shins as possible. Lift up onto the balls of your feet and lean forward even more, taking the weight of your torso onto the backs 
    of the upper arms. In Bakasana you consciously attempt to contract your front torso and round your back completely. To help yourself do this, 
    keep your tailbone as close to your heels as possible.
    
    Step 3 With an exhalation, lean forward even more onto the backs of your upper arms, to the point where the balls of your feet leave the floor. 
    Now your torso and legs are balanced on the backs of your upper arms. As a beginner at this pose, you might want to stop here, perched securely 
    on the bent arms.
    
    Step 4 But if you are ready to go further, squeeze the legs against the arms, press the inner hands firmly to the floor and (with an 
    inhalation) straighten the elbows. Seen from the side the arms are angled slightly forward relative to the floor. The inner knees 
    should be glued to the outer arms, high up near the armpits. Keep the head in a neutral position with your eyes looking at the floor, 
    or lift the head slightly, without compressing the back of the neck, and look forward.
    
    Step 5 Stay in the pose anywhere from 20 seconds to 1 minute. To release, exhale and slowly lower your feet to the floor, back into a squat.]],

    The full pose sometimes causes varying degrees of pain in the wrists. Instead of spreading the fingers on the floor, curl them slightly. 
    This should take some of the pressure off the wrists.]],
    tips=[[
    Beginners tend to move into this pose by lifting their buttocks high away from their heels. In Bakasana try to keep yourself tucked tight, 
    with the heels and buttocks close together. When you are ready to take the feet off the floor, push the upper arms against the shins and 
    draw your inner groins deep into the pelvis to help you with the lift.]],
    partnering=[[
    A partner can help you learn to balance in Bakasana, especially if you are reluctant to lean forward and take your feet off the floor. 
    Squat in the ready position, hands on the floor, up on the balls of your feet. Have the partner stand in front of you. As you lean 
    forward he/she will support your shoulders with his/her hands, to prevent you from toppling forward onto your face or head. 
    
    Stay for a few breaths, getting a taste for the balanced position, yet secure in the hands of your partner.]],
    variations=[[
    The most accessible variation of Bakasana is a twist: Parsva Bakasana (pronounced PARSH-vah, parsva = side or flank).
    
    Squat as described above, but keep your knees together. Exhale and turn your torso to the right, bracing the left elbow to the outside of 
    the right knee. Work the arm along the knee, until the knee is firm against the upper arm, near the armpit. Set the hands on the floor, 
    lean to the right, and lift the feet off the floor on an exhalation, balancing with the outer left arm pressed against the outer right leg. 
    Straighten the arms as much as possible, though no doubt for most students the elbows will remain slightly bent. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds, 
    exhale back to the squat, and repeat to the left for the same length of time.]]}

    name comes from the Sanskrit words, ""bhujanga” and ""asana"" (meaning ""serpent"" and ""pose,"" respectively). Cobra is an essential element 
    of Sun Salutations, and is an alternative to practicing Upward-Facing Dog (Urdhva Mukha Svanasana) in the Sun Salutations sequences.
    
    Cobra Pose can be a great way to stretch out your spine and chest throughout the day. It counteracts the slouch that comes from sitting in 
    front of a computer or driving. Bringing more flexibility to your spine will help you to feel more balanced, while opening your chest and 
    heart will energize and rejuvenate you throughout the day!]],

    Step 1
    Lie on the floor on your belly. Extend your legs behind you with the tops of your feet on the floor. Place your hands palm down on the 
    floor a couple inches away from your shoulders. 
    
    Squeeze your elbows towards your body rather than letting them splay out to the sides.
    
    Step 2
    Press firmly down through the tops of your feet and your thighs. Draw your tailbone toward the ground.
    
    Step 3
    On an inhale, reach your chest forward and up. Draw your shoulders away from your ears.
    
    Step 4
    Stay here or press into your palms and begin to straighten your elbows. Keep your legs engaged as you lift your chest forward and up.
    
    Step 5
    Stay in the pose for up to 30 seconds.
    
    Step 6
    To release, lower your body as you exhale and rest on the floor.
    
    ----------------------
    
    Step 1
    
    Lie prone on the floor. Stretch your legs back, tops of the feet on the floor. Spread your hands on the floor under your shoulders. 
    Hug the elbows back into your body.
    
    Step 2
    
    Press the tops of the feet and thighs and the pubis firmly into the floor.
    
    Step 3
    
    On an inhalation, begin to straighten the arms to lift the chest off the floor, going only to the height at which you can maintain a 
    connection through your pubis to your legs. Press the tailbone toward the pubis and lift the pubis toward the navel. Narrow the hip 
    points. Firm but don't harden the buttocks.
    
    Step 4
    
    Firm the shoulder blades against the back, puffing the side ribs forward. 
    
    Lift through the top of the sternum but avoid pushing the front ribs forward, which only hardens the lower back. Distribute the backbend 
    evenly throughout the entire spine.
    
    Step 5
    
    Hold the pose anywhere from 15 to 30 seconds, breathing easily. Release back to the floor with an exhalation.]],

    Cobra Pose is a great backbend for beginners. When done correctly, it can gradually bring flexibility and strength to the entire spine. 
    Remember to take it slowly and don’t push your body to achieve a deeper backbend. If you are experiencing discomfort in your back or neck, 
    only lift your chest as far as you can without causing pain. To deepen or lighten the pose, try these simple changes to find a variation 
    that works for you:
    
    - If your spine and shoulders are very stiff, or if you are pregnant, try practicing Cobra standing up instead of on the floor. Stand facing 
    a wall and place your palms against the wall, with your elbows hugged in to your sides. As you press against the wall, draw your shoulder 
    blades firmly into your upper back and broaden across your collar bones.
    
    - For those with more back strength, you can deepen the challenge by lifting your palms off the floor, keeping your chest lifted. Keep your 
    hands and arms in the same position as they were on the floor, but raise your hands a few inches off the mat. Maintain the pose for a few breaths. 
    This variation emphasizes lifting with the back muscles, rather than pressing the body away from the mat.]],
    deepen=[[
    If you have the flexibility in the armpits, chest, and groins you can move into a deeper backbend. Walk the hands a little farther forward and 
    straighten your elbows, turning the arms outward. Lift the top of the sternum straight toward the ceiling.
    
    Strongly engage your legs, pressing them down firmly on the floor. This will help to lift your chest higher in the pose.
    
    Be careful not to force yourself into the pose, striving for a deeper backbend. Do not push yourself into the pose! Instead, lift yourself 
    into it by using the strength of your back muscles and by pressing down through your thighs. You should be able to lift your hands off the 
    floor for a moment, feeling the lift through extension rather than force.
    
    Remember, the depth of your backbend doesn’t matter! What matters is the even distribution of curve and the ability to breathe smoothly while 
    in the pose.]],
    tips=[[
    Don't overdo the backbend. To find the height at which you can work comfortably and avoid straining your back, take your hands off the floor 
    for a moment, so that the height you find will be through extension.
    
    The Low Cobra variation of the pose is suitable for beginners and those with less spinal flexibility, while the High Cobra option is appropriate 
    for more advanced students. Those who are very stiff can benefit from practicing Cobra while standing, with their hands placed against a wall.]],
    partnering=[[
    Your partner can help you learn about the correct action of the pelvis in a backbend. Once in the pose, have your partner straddle your legs. 
    He/she should bend over and grip the sides of your pelvis, thumbs toward the sacrum, then spread the back of your pelvis, encourage your outer 
    hips to soften, and push your hip points toward each other.]]}

    The Shoulder Pressing Pose is known to be simple, yet it is only with practice that you get used to the pressure it exerts on the shoulders. 
    Patience and perseverance will give you the stamina, strength, balance, and will power to master this asana.
    
    -----------------------
    
    Bhujapidasana is a deep forward bend. We have to have sufficient flexibility to flex the hip joints to bring the torso through the thighs. 
    We are externally rotating at the hips to bring the feet toward each other. A strong intention of adduction with the thighs is necessary to 
    maintain the connection between the thighs and arms in this posture. That intention of actively pressing the inner leg (adduction) into 
    contact with the arm gives the posture its name: “arm-pressure posture”, or sometimes also translated as “shoulder-pressure posture”. 
    If we fold forward and touch our chin to do the full expression of this pose, we are doing extension of the neck to place our chin on the mat.]],
    benefits=[[
    This asana helps improve a sense of balance and concentration.
    It makes the wrists, shoulders, arms, and upper body strong.
    The abdomen gets a good stretch, and therefore, digestion is improved.
    This asana nourishes the thyroid gland. Therefore, the heart rate is controlled, the nervous system is balanced, and metabolism is regulated.
    The blood circulation is improved.
    This asana helps relieve stress and headache.]],
    goodFor={},
    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Begin this asana by squatting. Place your feet at a distance that is slightly lesser than the distance between your shoulders. Keep your knees wide.
    
    Step 2
    Angle your torso such that it faces forward, and place it between the inner thighs. As you lower your torso, your hips must be raised, such that 
    they come in line with the floor.
    
    Step 3
    Place the upper left shoulder as close to the back area of the left thigh, a little above your knees. Once you have done this, place the left 
    hand on the ground next to the outer part of your left foot. Do the same on your right side as well.
    
    Step 4
    This will make your upper back round up.
    
    Step 5
    Now that both your palms firmly press the ground, lift your body, placing its weight on your hands. The lifting happens because of a shift 
    in the center of gravity.
    
    Step 6
    Press the outer part of your arms along with the inner thighs as you place the right ankle over your left ankle. Gaze forward. Hold the pose. 
    Then, bend your elbows and release the pose as you exhale.]],

    The Cat-Cow Stretch (Chakravakasana) is a yoga essential and for good reason. It involves moving the spine from a rounded position (flexion)

    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Start on your hands and knees, aligning your wrists underneath your shoulders and your knees underneath your hips.

    Think of the spine as a straight line connecting the shoulders to the hips. Try visualizing the line extending forward through the crown 
    of the head and back through the tailbone. This is the position of a neutral spine.
    
    Step 3
    Keep the neck long by looking down and out.

    Curl your toes under.
    
    Step 5
    Tilt your pelvis back so that your tailbone sticks up.
    
    Step 6
    Let this movement ripple from your tailbone up your spine so that your neck is the last thing to move.

    Your belly drops down, but keep your abdominal muscles hugging your spine by drawing your navel in.

    Step 1
    Sit on the floor with your legs together and extended in front of your torso. If your torso is leaning back, it may be because tight hamstrings 
    are dragging the sitting bones toward the knees and the back of the pelvis toward the floor. It may be helpful to sit on a blanket or a bolster 
    to lift the pelvis.
    
    Step 2
    A simple way to check alignment is to sit with your back against a wall. The sacrum and the shoulder blades should touch the wall, but not lower 
    back or the back of the head. Put a small rolled-up towel between the wall and the lower back.
    
    Step 3
    Sit towards the front of the sitting bones, and adjust the pubis and tail bone equidistant from the floor. Without hardening the belly, firm the 
    thighs, press them down against the floor (or your support), rotate them slightly toward each other, and draw the inner groins toward the sacrum. 
    Flex your ankles, pressing out through your heels.
    
    Step 4
    To lengthen your front torso perpendicular to the floor, think of energy streaming upward from the pubis to the sternum, then down the back from 
    the shoulders to the tail bone. Then imagine the tail lengthening into the floor.

    challenge yourself to practice strong alignment with good humor and one leg up in the air!]],

    ---------------
    
    Downward-Facing Dog is one of the most well-known yoga poses for a reason—it can be done by almost anyone, and is an amazing stretching and 
    strengthening exercise for the entire body.
    
    It stretches the torso, strengthens the arms and legs, and rests and rejuvenates the brain. Three-Legged Downward-Facing Dog provides all the 
    great benefits of Down Dog, but also stretches the inner and outer hip, side body, and improves balance.]],
    goodFor={},
    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Begin in Tabletop Pose, on hands and knees, with your shoulders stacked directly over your wrists, and your hips stacked directly over your knees.
    
    Step 2
    Take a look down at your hands. Ensure that the creases of the wrists are parallel to the short edge of the mat, that the fingers are spread wide, 
    and that the weight is distributed evenly through the palms and the knuckles, particularly of the pointer and middle finger.
    
    Step 3
    On an exhale, tuck your toes under and begin to slowly extend the legs, lifting the hips up high toward the ceiling. Keep the knees bent for as 
    long as you need to here in order to maintain the length along the spine.
    
    Step 4
    Continue lifting the hips high and back, and press the tops of your thighs toward the back of the room. Keep your ears in line with your arms, 
    and firm up through the upper outer arm.
    
    Step 5
    Remain in Downward-Facing Dog for three deep breaths, creating space in the legs and drawing the heels closer to the ground.
    
    Step 6
    On an inhale, extend your right leg up high and back, lifting it up toward the ceiling. Avoid the tendency to tilt the pelvis and open up 
    through the hips immediately in an effort to lift the leg as high as possible; rather, keep the hips level with one another and the right 
    foot flexed (with the heel reaching back and the toes pointing down toward the ground).
    
    Step 7
    You can remain here with the hips level if this feels like enough—or, to move even deeper, begin to bend your right knee so that your foot 
    drops over to the left. Point your bent knee up toward the ceiling and begin to open up and stack your hips directly on top of one another.
    
    Step 8
    The weight will want to shift into the left side here. Keep the weight evenly distributed across both palms and drop the right shoulder so 
    that the upper body remains squared.
    
    Step 9
    Stay in the pose for five to ten breaths, then slowly square off the hips and lower the extended leg on an exhale. Gently walk out the legs in 
    Downward-Facing Dog, then repeat on the other side.]],

    As it is, Three-Legged Downward-Facing Dog is already a challenging variation on the standard pose. For an even greater challenge, try it 
    one-handed: When your right leg is lifted, reach your left arm straight behind you. Rest the back of your hand on your low back. Come back 
    to Downward-Facing Dog and repeat on the other side.]],
    tips=[[
    Since Downward-Facing Dog is the foundation for Three-Legged Downward Dog, it’s important to get the alignment correct first in Downward-Facing Dog.
    You can use Three-Legged Downward Dog as a transitional pose for a Vinyasa or Flow practice. From the lifted-leg position, exhale as you lower your 
    leg and sweep your leg below your body. Place your foot on the floor between your hands. Lift your torso to come directly into a standing pose, or 
    Crescent Lunge.
    Remember, your standing heel does not need to touch the ground. Do not worry about it — avoid walking your feet closer to your hands for this purpose. 
    Maintain the length of your spine and the lift of your pelvis.
    
    --------------------------
    
    It doesn’t matter whether or not your heels can touch the ground in Downward-Facing Dog. The key action here is to lengthen evenly through the 
    spine and legs. Forcing the heels down rounds the spine and compromises the alignment of the pose. If you like, you can try placing a rolled 
    up yoga mat or blanket under your heels to provide some extra support.
    This variation of Downward-Facing Dog is great for runners and cyclists, who usually have notoriously tight hips and legs.
    As you begin to lift the leg in Downward-Facing Dog, imagine there is a straight line that is drawn from the outer edge of your arm all the way 
    up your leg. This may help with your alignment.

    One of the most likely places to get stuck when you're learning Flying Crow is trying to straighten your back leg and keep it off the floor 
    at the same time. As you're learning, it is fine to keep that back leg bent and gradually work on straightening it as you find your balance.
    
    To achieve this, it is crucial that you keep your head up and your body weight moving forward. Allowing your head to drop creates a powerful 
    pull toward the floor, which you don't want. The weight of your torso needs to stay forward to balance out the weight of your back leg. 
    Arm balances may look like they require a lot of arm strength, but they're really more about controlling your center of gravity through your core.
    
    One way to improve your balance is to focus on the poses that come before it.]],

    goodFor={},
    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Come into it from a standing position. First bend your knees as if to squat, then take your left knee to the floor. Turn your left foot so 
    it points to the right and sit on the heel. Cross your right foot over your left thigh and place it, sole down, beside your left knee. 
    Your right knee should point toward the ceiling.
    
    Step 2
    To twist, bring your left waist, side ribs, and shoulder around to the right. Place your left upper arm across your right thigh and slide 
    your left outer armpit down the outside of the thigh. Use movements similar to those you used in Parsva Bakasana to maximize your twist and 
    make good contact between your left upper arm and right outer thigh. Maintaining this contact high on the arm and far to the outside of the 
    thigh is the secret to the pose.
    
    Step 3
    To place your hands on the floor, first straighten your left elbow and put your left palm down (you may need to lean to the right to bring 
    your hand all the way down). To place your right hand, carefully lift both hips without losing the left-arm-to-right-thigh placement, lean 
    even more to the right, and put your right hand on the floor. Your hands should be shoulder width apart, with your middle fingers parallel 
    to each other. Most of your weight will still be on your knees and feet.
    
    Step 4
    Without losing contact between your left arm and your right outer thigh, lift your hips so you can flip your left foot and stand on the ball 
    of the foot, heel up. Next, lift your left knee off the floor so most of your weight is on your feet. Lift your hips a little higher and start 
    shifting your weight to bring your whole torso above and between your hands with its midline parallel to your middle fingers. Leaning your 
    weight slightly forward, bend your left elbow a little, then tilt your head and shoulders a bit toward the floor. This should leverage your 
    right foot up in the air. When your right foot is up, lean your weight farther forward until your left foot becomes light, then lifts up with 
    an exhale.
    
    Step 5
    To finish the pose, straighten both knees simultaneously with an inhale. 
    
    Lift the left leg until it's parallel to the floor. Bending your left elbow more, lift your right foot higher, and reach out through the balls 
    of both feet. Adjust the height of your right shoulder so it's the same as the left. Lift your chest to bring your torso parallel to the floor. 
    Breathing smoothly, hold the pose for 20 seconds or longer, then release both feet to the floor with an exhale.

    From your hands and knees, bring your right knee forward to the floor just behind your right hand.

    Outwardly rotate your right thigh so your right foot is in front of your left knee, shin at a 45-degree angle with your thigh on the floor. 
    Strongly flex your right foot to align the ankle and shinbone and prevent the ankle sickling inward. The further away the foot is from your 
    knee, the greater the outward rotation in the hip, and the greater the challenge.
    
    Step 3
    Curl your left toes under and begin to press the floor away, walking your knee further away behind you until your leg is fully extended with 
    your shin, knee, and thigh in contact with the floor. The right knee may come slightly outside of the line of your pelvis.
    
    Step 4
    Flex your inner thighs toward each other, squaring the hips, and lifting your pelvis slightly higher.

    Find the middle point where equal weight is between your left and right sides, and your pelvis is squared to the front of your mat.

    hips square and level.

    Uncurl your left toes, looking back to see that your ankle is in line with your shin and your leg is running in a straight line behind you.
    
    Step 9
    On an inhale, send your tailbone down toward the earth and the crown of your head up toward the sky.
    
    Step 10
    Exhale and slowly walk your hands forward in front of you, placing elbows on the floor or arms extended in front of you with torso on the floor.

    Slowly walk your hands back up toward your body, placing your hands slightly wider than shoulder width. Send the head of the arm bones back, 
    allowing your upper chest to lift slightly so the collarbones are broad.
    
    Step 13
    Inhale, sending your tailbone down and your crown up, walking your hands closer and closer to the body on an exhale so the torso is moving 
    toward an upright posture. Breathe here for five breaths or continue with the advanced pose below.
    
    Step 14
    Advanced A – If you are able to painlessly and evenly stay in this posture while removing your right hand from the earth, you may reach 
    your right arm behind you with the palm up. Draw your lower belly in to stabilize your spine, inner thighs moving toward each other. 
    
    Bend your right knee and grasp the flexed foot with your hand. You may stay here and breathe or progress to the next stage.
    
    Step 15
    Advanced B – Point your foot and slowly shift your hand to the toes of the foot by outwardly rotating your arm deeper, slowly lifting the 
    elbow forward, upward, and eventually backward so the palm is facing down. Press your left support hand into the floor to lengthen your 
    waistline, keeping even weight in the left and right sides of the body. Breathe here or progress to the next stage.
    
    Step 16
    Advanced C – If you are able to maintain your balance and stability, draw the lower belly in, flex your inner thighs toward each other, lift 
    your left arm up and back, grasping your foot with both hands. Send the head of the arm bone back into the socket, keep the action of your 
    lower belly and legs, and breathe.

    This pose is an intermediate backbend. You should check with a doctor before performing the pose if you have any of the following conditions:
    
    Knee injury, meniscus or ligament injury
    Sacroiliac joint injury. The opposing action of the legs in this pose may increase strain across the joint
    History of shoulder dislocation. Do not progress to holding the top of the foot behind the back and use caution reaching behind you for the foot.]],
    mods=[[
    Low Back Pain 
    
    – If at any point you feel low back pain in the pose, back off, draw in your low belly, and lengthen through your spine to avoid compression. 
    A folded blanket, foam block, or bolster under the bent leg thigh will add support and may relieve the pain. Do not continue in pain.
    
    Knee Position – The knee is a hinge joint (open-close) and therefore should not be challenged from side to side. In pigeon pose, the weight 
    of the body and the pressure of the floor challenge the knee joint on either side. It is important to keep the ankle in dorsi flexion (toes up), 
    and not flexed inward, to align the shinbone. 
    
    If you are feeling any tension or pain around the front knee, back off, place the foot closer to the opposite groin, and consider a supportive 
    blanket, block, or bolster under the thigh. Do not continue in pain.
    
    Progressing to Advanced Versions – To begin bending the back leg, you may use a belt around your foot rather than holding it your hand. Before 
    entering the pose, make a small loop in a strap and place it around the back foot at the area of the ball of the foot. Set up the length of the 
    strap on the floor beside you. Enter the first phase of the pose, and during the second phase, bend the knee and grasp the strap A) with the 
    same-side arm behind you palm up, B) to advance further, turn the palm down, externally rotating the shoulder sending the elbow forward, up, 
    and back, and C) further still, with both hands behind you, elbows forward, up, and back. In each stage, slowly walk the hand(s) back so the 
    tension increases on the strap, always mindful of knee and low back pinching.]],

    This intermediate hip-opening backbend stretches the hips, back, and shoulders. While this can help with relief from discomfort and prevent 
    strain, exercise caution. Go slowly and don’t push your body beyond its limits.]],

    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Begin on all fours, with your knees directly below your hips, and your hands slightly ahead of your shoulders. Slide your right knee forward 
    to the back of your right wrist; at the same time angle your right shin under your torso and bring your right foot to the front of your left 
    knee. The outside of your right shin will now rest on the floor. Slowly slide your left leg back, straightening the knee and descending the 
    front of the thigh to the floor. Lower the outside of your right buttock to the floor. Position the right heel just in front of the left hip.
    
    Step 2
    The right knee can angle slightly to the right, outside the line of the hip. Look back at your left leg. It should extend straight out of 
    the hip (and not be angled off to the left), and rotated slightly inwardly, so its midline presses against the floor. Exhale and lay your 
    torso down on the inner right thigh for a few breaths. Stretch your arms forward.
    
    Step 3
    Then slide your hands back toward the front shin and push your fingertips firmly to the floor. Lift your torso away from the thigh. Lengthen 
    the lower back by pressing your tailbone down and forward; at the same time, and lift your pubis toward the navel. Roll your left hip point 
    toward the right heel, and lengthen the left front groin.
    
    Step 4
    If you can maintain the upright position of your pelvis without the support of your hands on the floor, bring your hands to the top rim of 
    your pelvis. Push heavily down. Against this pressure, lift the lower rim of your rib cage. The back ribs should lift a little faster than 
    the front. Without shortening the back of your neck, drop your head back. To lift your chest, push the top of your sternum (at the manubrium) 
    straight up toward the ceiling.
    
    Step 5
    Stay in this position for a minute. Then, with your hands back on the floor, carefully slide the left knee forward, then exhale and lift up 
    and back into Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward Facing Dog Pose). Take a few breaths, drop the knees to all-fours on another exhalation, and 
    repeat with the legs reversed for the same length of time.]],

    Eka Pada Rajakapotasana is actually the first in a series of four, increasingly difficult Pigeon poses. In each of the three successive 
    poses, the forward leg is placed in a slightly different position. In the second variation the forward foot is standing on the floor 
    just in front of the same-side buttock, with the knee angled well forward of the heel. In the third variation the forward leg is in 
    Ardha Virasana, while in the fourth the leg is stretched straight forward (as in Hanumanasana or Monkey Pose) of the pelvis.
    
    For the full pose, first perform the preliminary leg position. Then with your hands braced on the floor, bend the back knee and bring the 
    foot as close to the top of your head as possible. Inhale, stretch the right arm upward; then exhale, bend the elbow, and reach back and 
    grasp the inside of the left foot. After a few breaths, reach back with the left hand and grasp the outside of the foot. Draw the sole 
    of the foot as close as possible to the crown of your head. Hold this position for 30 seconds. Then release the foot, lower the leg, 
    perform step 5 to change the position of the legs and repeat on the second side for the same length of time.]],

    involves sitting straight on a mat or a blanket. Sit up straight but stay relaxed. Then stretch your legs ahead in front of you while 
    straightening your back. Your spine should be erect.
    
    If you have back problems or face difficulty in holding a pose then you may use a wall for support. Your legs and feet should be hip width 
    apart and parallel. Continue your breathing and hold one of your hands in front of your nose to check which one of your nostrils is active.
    
    If your right nostril is active then grab the right ankle or just the vice versa, bend the knee while you inhale, then bring the leg over 
    your head and place it on your neck while you exhale. Hold the pose for at least 30 seconds and breathe.]],

    Beginners might find it difficult to practice this pose in the initial days. This pose demands flexibility and strength in your legs. 
    You need to warm up your body before you attempt this pose. Hugging the shin towards the chest helps to open the hips and hamstrings 
    over the days. You can also practice Half Happy Baby pose to gain flexibility.

    hours before you do the asana so that your food gets properly digested, and you can expand your body fully during the practice.
    
    Ensure to warm up your body mainly the hamstrings, core and hips. When you lift your leg behind your head, ensure that you are doing 
    it carefully and gently. Otherwise, you may cause injuries to the muscles if done incorrectly or suddenly. Check that your leg is 
    flexible enough to place it over the shoulder? Don’t force your body at any stage during the pose. Take your own time. With regular

    Stand in Tadasana. Bend your knees slightly, lift your left foot up and, balancing on your right foot, cross your left thigh over the right. 
    Point your left toes toward the floor, press the foot back, and then hook the top of the foot behind the lower right calf. Balance on the right foot.

    Stretch your arms straight forward, parallel to the floor, and spread your scapulas wide across the back of your torso. Cross the arms in front of 
    your torso so that the right arm is above the left, then bend your elbows. Snug the right elbow into the crook of the left, and raise the forearms 
    perpendicular to the floor. The backs of your hands should be facing each other.
    
    Step 3
    
    Press the right hand to the right and the left hand to the left, so that the palms are now facing each other. The thumb of the right hand should 
    pass in front of the little finger of the left. Now press the palms together (as much as is possible for you), lift your elbows up, and stretch 
    the fingers toward the ceiling.

    of the left hip. Try to bring the heels equidistant from the hips: with the right leg on top you'll have to tug the right heel in closer to the 
    left hip. Sit evenly on the sitting bones.
    
    Step 2
    
    Inhale and stretch your right arm straight out to the right, parallel to the floor. Rotate your arm inwardly; the thumb will turn first toward 
    the floor, then point toward the wall behind you, with the palm facing the ceiling. This movement will roll your right shoulder slightly up 
    and forward, and round your upper back. With a full exhalation, sweep the arm behind your torso and tuck the forearm in the hollow of your 
    lower back, parallel to your waist, with the right elbow against the right side of your torso. Roll the shoulder back and down, then work the 
    forearm up your back until it is parallel to your spine. The back of your hand will be between your shoulder blades. See that your right elbow 
    doesn't slip away from the right side of your torso.

    another inhalation, stretch the arm straight up toward the ceiling, palm turned back. Lift actively through your left arm, then with an 
    exhalation, bend the elbow and reach down for the right hand. If possible, hook the right and left fingers.

    Gomukhasana is a notoriously difficult pose for tight-shouldered people, who aren't able to hook their fingers together. The simple solution 
    to this dilemma is to hold a strap between the hands. Begin the pose with a strap draped over the shoulder of the bottom arm. In step 2, as 
    you swing the bottom arm behind your back, slide the forearm as high on the back torso as possible (Remember to keep the elbow close to your 
    side), then grab the bottom end of the strap. In step 3, stretch the other arm overhead and then reach down the back for the other end of the 
    strap. Pull with the top arm. See if you can draw the bottom arm higher onto the back. You're trying to work the hands toward each other and 
    eventually clasp them. Be aware too that you may be able to clasp the hands on one side, but not the other.]],

    In this pose (and its companion, Salamba Sarvangasana) there's a tendency to overstretch the neck by pulling the shoulders too far away

    Exhale and lean your torso forward, pressing your fingertips to the floor. Slowly slide your left knee back, straightening the knee and at 
    the same time descending the right thigh toward the floor. Stop straightening the back knee just before you reach the limit of your stretch.

    Step 3
    Now begin to push the right heel away from your torso. Because we started with a strong external rotation of the front leg, gradually turn 
    the leg inward as it straightens to bring the kneecap toward the ceiling. As the front leg straightens, resume pressing the left knee back, 
    and carefully descend the front of the left thigh and the back of the right leg (and the base of the pelvis) to the floor. Make sure the 
    center of the right knee points directly up toward the ceiling.

    Step 4
    Also check to see that the back leg extends straight out of the hip (and isn't angled out to the side), and that the center of the back 
    kneecap is pressing directly on the floor. Keep the front leg active by extending through the heel and lifting the ball of the foot toward 
    the ceiling. Bring the hands into Anjali Mudra (Salutation Seal) or stretch the arms straight up toward the ceiling.

    Maha Mudra is said to be a quintessential yoga asana because it combines the elements of all 5 directional movements of the spine: forward 
    bend, back bend, twist, lateral bend and, of course, axial extension. Therefore we need to include poses for each one of those directions in 
    preparation for Maha Mudra. Done with care, this pose can create an incredible sense of height, depth and spaciousness.]],
    benefits=[[
    The mudra improves digestion and heals stomach disorders.
    Maha Mudra helps to remove leprosy, consumption, and colic as well as other diseases that are caused by indigestion.
    
    Maha Mudra can effectively neutralize the effect of various toxins present in the body.
    Maha Mudra also helps to remove Kapha disorders, constipation, tuberculosis, prolonged fever, enlarged spleen, and various other diseases, 
    thus helping the body to attain good health.
    
    Practicing Maha Mudra presents supernatural powers or siddhis that can transform the consciousness.
    It helps to balance the sympathetic as well as parasympathetic nervous systems, thus helping the practitioner to achieve inner peace. Sensory 
    excitements can be reduced greatly with Maha Mudra which helps a person to achieve a perfectly tranquil and relaxed state of mind.
    
    By practicing Maha Mudra on a regular basis, it is possible to make the spine perfectly straight. This, in turn, facilitates pranic energy to 
    move smoothly and clearly between the Mooladhara chakra and Vishuddhi chakra. It helps to charge the whole body with pranic energy. During 
    this mudra, the holding the breath leads to the contraction of the throat. This pushes prana down towards the Apana. The two then merge at 
    Manipuraka Chakra or the navel center which helps to awaken Prana Shakti.
    
    As this mudra is performed along with Shambhavi Mudra or eyebrow gazing, it helps to relax the mind. This makes it a great practice before 
    starting meditation.
    
    With the awakening of Prana Shakti, the activity of Pingala Nadi and Ida largely subside. This helps to activate the Sushumna Nadi or the central channel.
    
    The Maha Mudra helps a person to become compassionate and loving. It also removes self-centeredness from consciousness.
    
    The Mudra helps in increasing concentration power as well as self-confidence.
    It helps to enhance the functioning capacity of the immune system.
    The mudra also strengthens various muscle groups, such as lower back muscles, upper back muscles, abdominal muscles, and shoulder muscles.]],

    Uttana Shishosana is one of the easiest and most basic yoga poses or asanas, making it the perfect one for beginners. It is a combination of 
    two different asanas, the Child Pose and the Downward Facing Dog Pose. It exercises various parts of your body, such as upper arms, shoulders, 
    neck, back, chest, hips, abdomen and hamstrings.]],
    benefits=[[
    This pose relieves stress by deeply stretching the spine. It increases self-confidence and fosters a feeling of self-love. If you have a desk 
    job or you are feeling fatigued, practicing this asana will release any accumulated tension in your body.
    
    Uttana Shishosana, also known as the Extended Puppy Pose, focuses primarily on the back, shoulders and arm areas. 
    
    In fact, it strengthens the hips and back muscles. However, if performed carefully, it can also activate your abdominal muscles, thereby aiding 
    in digestion, reducing bloating and helping to burn stubborn belly fat.
    
    This yoga pose increases the flexibility of your spinal cord and muscles. It also improves a person’s posture and is an exceptional way to regulate 
    Prana, the life-giving force.
    
    Uttana Shishosana is a great heart opener. It expands your chest, thereby decreasing the tension in the back and shoulder areas. As a result, the 
    breathing capacity of your lungs improves.
    
    In this yoga pose, the blood flows toward the shoulders and the chest. This enhances blood circulation and has a positive impact on the body. The 
    asana also stretches the hamstrings and reduces chronic muscular tension.
    
    Lastly, the Extended Puppy Pose works as a stress buster. It relaxes the body and calms the mind. It also induces sleep and thus helps people who 
    have insomnia.
    
    The contemporary world is cut-throat and competitive. As a result, many people become pessimistic and end up losing their confidence. Uttana Shishosana, 
    well known for its mental benefits, activates the Heart (Anahata) Chakra. This Chakra gives an extra boost to your self-confidence, and you start feeling 
    more cheerful and optimistic. Furthermore, the asana also makes it easy for you to accept yourself and others just as they are.
    
    In addition to the Heart Chakra, practicing the Extended Puppy Pose also activates your Throat (Vishuddha) Chakra, Sacral (Swadhisthana) Chakra and 
    Root (Muladhara) Chakra.]],

    feet on the mat, toes pointing straight back. Keep your feet parallel and hip-width apart.
    
    Step 2
    On an exhalation, begin to walk your hands out in front of you. Allow your chest to melt toward the floor as you slowly release your forehead 
    to the mat.
    
    Step 3
    Spread your fingers and press firmly into the thumb and index fingers. Activate Hasta Bandha (Hand Lock) by rooting into your finger pads 
    and creating a lifting action like a suction cup in your palms. Roll your upper arm bones outward away from your ears to broaden the shoulders. 
    Feel your triceps wrapping down toward the outer edges of the mat as your biceps spin up toward the ceiling. Keep your arms active and lift 
    your elbows slightly off the mat.
    
    Step 4
    On your next inhalation, deepen into the stretch by reaching your hips up and back toward the wall behind you; meanwhile, continue to let your 
    chest melt down toward the floor. Gently hug in—or corset—your front ribs to support your spine and prevent collapsing into the lower back.

    Even though this pose is easy and straightforward, there are a few things that should be kept in mind while practicing it. If you have knee

    You can skip Uttana Shishosana if you have stiff arms and shoulders. Also, if you suffer from severe lower back pain, then it is recommended 
    that you don’t practice this pose because it may aggravate your pain and make your back stiffer.

    fetus and the mother.]],

    hips is the one that may it possible on one side but not the other.

    Garland Pose can provide a deep stretch to your hips and groin! If you’d like to deepen or lighten the pose, try these simple changes to find 
    a variation that works best for you:
    
    - If your heels don’t come to the floor, place a folded, firm blanket or rolled yoga mat underneath them.
    
    - Experienced students may step their feet completely together.
    
    - Women who are pregnant and those who need help balancing have a few options:
    
    a) Rest both hands on the back of a chair.
    
    b) Rest one hand along a wall to the side of the body.
    
    c) Do the pose with your back against a wall.
    
    - More experienced students can drape the torso between the legs:
    
    a) Reach both arms forward, then bend the elbows and bring the shins into the armpits.
    
    b) Extend the arms behind your body and clasp the heels.
    
    c) Drop the forehead to the mat]],

    When held for longer periods of time, Malasana is a great warm up. If your hips and lower back allow, try beginning your practice with 
    Garland Pose and enjoy the opening and heat created from the posture.
    
    ------------------------
    
    Practicing Garland Pose can be a great way to challenge your balance and loosen tight hips. It might be difficult at first, but with practice, 
    your muscles will lengthen and you will be able to squat. Keep the following in mind when practicing this pose:
    
    - Avoid jerking, pulling, pushing, or forcing any movement in this pose. Let your movements be slow and smooth.
    
    - Do not bounce your hips up and down. Doing so can overstrain your knees and hip flexors.
    
    - Keep shifting your weight back into your heels.
    
    - Lengthen the front of your torso and keep your spine long, not rounded.]],

    Ganesh Mantra 
    
    The grounding quality of Malasana makes it a great pose for learning how to stay rooted to overcome obstacles. The following mantra honors 
    Ganesha, the elephant deity who removes obstacles in our lives. To practice, say or chant, “Om Gum Ganapatayei Namah,” which means, “I bow 
    to the elephant-faced deity [Ganesh] who is capable of removing all obstacles. I pray for blessings and protection.”

    Rum bum lum dhum
    
    By chanting this mantra before, during or after your exercise, you aid in this exercise’s ability to affect the stimulation of digestive 
    organs and metabolism. This mantra is also believed to reduce the levels of sugar in the body, making it beneficial for people with diabetic 
    conditions as well. “Rum” is thought to activate the liver, stomach and pancreas, while “Bum” ignites the spleen and “Lum” begins the body’s 
    absorption process. “Dhum” is used as to elicit comfort and the recitation of this chant will help with the digestion of any food.]],

    Sit in Dandasana (Staff Pose). Bend your left knee and place the foot on the floor, with the heel as close to the left sitting bone as possible. 
    Keep the right leg strong and rotated slightly inward, grounding the head of the thighbone into the floor. Press the back of the right heel and 
    the base of the big toe away from the pelvis. Make sure the inner left thigh presses firmly against the left side of the torso.

    As a preparation for the full pose, twist your torso to the right and press the back of the left shoulder against the inside of the left knee. 
    Use this leverage to lengthen the left side of the torso along the thigh. Then gently unwind and face forward.
    
    Step 3

    tips=[[
    Because of tightness in the groins, beginners often have difficulty keeping the bent-knee thigh close to the side of the torso. This makes

    eliminated and digestive power is restored.  These asana also directly benefit the kidneys.  These poses relieve pain from menstruation and 
    strengthen the womb allowing a woman to carry a child strongly-miscarriage due to weakness is cured, although pregnant women should not practice

    side of the torso snug against the inside of the right thigh. Reach the left arm forward, toward the right foot; then with an exhalation, sweep 
    the arm around the leg and notch the right shin in the crook of the left elbow. Bring the back of the left hand to the outside of the left hip. 
    Finally with another exhalation, complete the twist by swinging your right arm around the back and clasp the right wrist in your left hand (or 
    have a strap handy to use if the two hands don't reach). Stay for an equal length of time on both sides, from 30 seconds to 1 minute.]],
    tips=[[
    It's often difficult for beginners to sit upright after bending the knee as described in step 1. The pelvis tends to sink backward, which 
    rounds the back and could cause back pain. To offset this probli and keep the pelvis in a neutral position, sit on a thickly folded blanket or bolster.]],

    Step 2
    Inhaling place your LEFT leg in half lotus, turning the sole of your foot upward and if your hip allows, moving your heel toward your navel 
    and your left knee toward your right knee.
    
    Step 3
    Bend your right knee and ground your right foot, heel close to your outer hip. If the lotus position is a challenge for you or puts stress 
    in your knee you can drop your leg out of lotus and place it under the right thigh for the time being (see picture of Frank). Spending extra 
    time in Baddha Konasana and requesting assists will help open and prepare the hips for Marichyasana D.
    
    Step 4
    Place your right hand behind you and close to your sacrum with your fingers pointing away from your body. Slide your left lotus leg forward 
    and your right hip back so your hips are not square and your left knee is forward of your right foot. Lean into your left leg grounding it, 
    your right hip will most likely lift off the floor—you now have a tripod of support consisting of your left thigh and hip and your right foot.
    
    Step 5
    Twisting to the right slide your left arm around your right knee, inhaling as you lift your spine up and out of your pelvis and exhaling as 
    you twist the thorax. Keep your knee upright, neither allowing it to flare out or collapse across your body. Many will need to stay in this 
    position until the hips, lower back, and/or shoulder allows deeper twisting. See picture of Krista.
    
    Step 6
    To go to the next level in the pose continue sliding your underarm toward your right thigh, if your shoulder can come in alignment with your 
    knee you are ready to internally rotate your left arm and reach around your leg and eventually around your back. Leaning into your left thigh 
    lift your right hand off the floor and reach around your back clasping your hands for the bind. Look over your right shoulder, gazing out the 
    right corners of your eyes.
    
    Step 7
    Sit up tall while you sit down, inhaling to get length in your spine lifting your heart as you ground through the tripod of support you created, 
    exhaling as you deepen the twist. Flex your left heel into your abdomen for further de-toxifying of the internal organs. Hold here for 5-8 deep breaths.

    1. Start with the tabletop position.
    
    2. Then, exhale to take on the countermovement, and turn your head and focus your eyes on your left hip.
    
    3. As you do this, gently move your hip towards your head. Inhale, and return to the start position before you repeat the movement on the other side.
    
    Second Variation
    
    1. Begin with the tabletop position.
    
    2. Then, move your hands forward as you move your hips in circular motions.
    
    3. Inhale and move forward, then exhale and move backwards.]],

    description=[[
    Peacock Pose (Mayurasana) is an advanced hand-balancing yoga pose. It is most associated with Hatha yoga, though it’s practiced in other 
    types of yoga as well.
    By balancing on your hands, your wrists and forearms are stretched and your core and back are engaged. This pose is a great way to release 
    tension in the body, elongate your limbs and challenge your balancing skills.
    
    Due to its advanced nature, this yoga pose is best incorporated near the middle or end of a sequence of postures, such as a sun salutation or 
    sequence of seated poses. Prepare for this advanced yoga pose by opening up the body parts that are targeted. The wrists are especially prone 
    to straining, so wrist stretches are encouraged.
    
    Very little equipment is required to master this pose — just a yoga mat and you. Beginners may want to ease into the pose with a yoga block or 
    other foundational prop for support.]],
    benefits=[[
    Balancing poses like Peacock Pose are beneficial for building core strength necessary for other advanced poses. You will feel the stretch the 
    deepest in your wrists and forearms, though your core will also be engaged. As you balance your body on your hands, the extension of your legs 
    will help release tension by opening up your back.
    
    As you squeeze your legs together to keep your lower body above the ground, your pelvis will also open up, and your thigh muscles will become 
    engaged. This stretch opens up and strengths the whole body. The anti-gravity aspect of Peacock Pose may appeal to people who stand on their 
    feet for long hours during the day.
    
    Many advanced arm poses require enough upper body strength to balance the rest of the body. It takes a lot of regular practice for people of 
    all experience levels to master this pose and experience the benefits. Incorporating this hand-balancing pose will prepare you for other yoga 
    poses that require upper body strength and balance.]],
    goodFor={},
    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Start in an upright seated position. Sit on your knees and heels in the Hero Pose (Virasana). Keeping some distance between your knees will 
    open up your hips.
    
    Step 2
    Lean your shoulders forward and place your hands on the ground in front of you. As you lean forward, your elbows will bend slightly. Make sure 
    your hands and elbows face inward towards your heart.
    
    Step 3
    As you press your palms into the floor, your torso will press against the back of your upper arms. Your head will come forward towards the mat.
    
    Step 4
    Unbend your knees and extend your legs behind you, toes facing the floor. Your bodyweight should be distributed on your hands and feet. 
    
    Step 5
    Engage your core as you prepare to shift the weight of your lower body to your upper body.
    
    Step 6
    Squeeze your thighs together so your legs become one unit. Use your toes to shift the weight to your upper body.
    
    Step 7
    Lift your feet off the ground one at a time. As you regain balance in your arms, lift your legs so that they are parallel to the ground.
    
    Step 8
    Lift your head and look forward. Hold the pose for 15-30 seconds, keeping your core, pelvis, and thighs engaged.
    
    Step 9
    Release the pose by lowering your feet to the ground, then your knees. Lift off of your hands and sit back on your knees and heels to take 
    the pressure off of your wrists.]],
    contra=[[
    If you experience pain in your wrists, arms or hands during this pose, release it safely.
    
    Do not do Peacock Pose after abdominal surgery because the elbows apply pressure to the stomach during this pose. Check with your doctor to 
    see how long after surgery you can perform this pose.
    
    Pregnant women should not perform this pose as your stomach rests on your elbows.
    
    There is strong involvement of the wrists and other arm joints in this yoga pose. People with wrist and elbow injuries should abstain from 
    placing pressure on these body parts]],
    mods=[[
    Peacock Pose is an advanced yoga pose because it requires upper body strength and balance. If you can’t lift up your legs while remaining 
    balanced and secure on your hands, there are some modifications and beginner-friendly poses to help you ease into the final pose.
    
    First, beginners should warm up with a plank pose, such as Low Plank (Chaturanga Dandasana). If you are at the intermediate level, you can 
    warm up with the Crow Pose (Bakasana).
    
    Try resting a yoga block under your pelvis. This will help you stabilize your form as you lift your feet off the ground. It will also help 
    you ease into the pose by encouraging proper balance. With practice, you may be able to perform Peacock Pose without these modifications.]],
    deepen=[[
    To make Peacock Pose more challenging, try some of these techniques. Lift your legs higher than your head without allowing your head to return 
    to the floor. You can also graduate to a one-armed Peacock Pose.
    
    Peacock Pose is truly unique as its one of few arm-balancing yoga poses where the hands are facing inward. However, there are other advanced 
    poses that will challenge your ability to balance your body weight on your hands and arms.
    
    Once you’ve mastered Peacock Pose, use your balancing skills to do Hurdler Pose (Eka Pada Koundinyasana II). This is an advanced arm balance 
    pose where one leg is extended to your side. Hurdler Pose will also strengthen your arms, which is why it complements Peacock Pose nicely.]],
    tips=[[
    It’s important to avoid these common mistakes to maintain proper form and prevent injury or sprain. Extra caution is needed to avoid straining the wrists.
    
    Don’t start your sequence with this pose
    This pose should be done near the middle or end of your sequence. 
    
    Warm-up to this pose with beginner poses that improve strength and balance. Utilize other arm-balancing poses to ease your wrists into this advanced 
    stretch. If needed, perform wrist stretches to avoid strain.
    
    Rocking back and forth at the top of the pose
    As you try to balance the weight of your lower body on your hands and arms, you may feel like a seesaw or teeter-totter. Keep your elbows narrowed in. 
    Your arms should not be shoulder-length apart, but rather closer together. This will create a strong foundation for the pose. Additionally, you may 
    just need more practice on improving balance.
    
    Leaning too far forward
    This is called a balancing pose for a reason. Though most of the bodyweight is carried by the upper body, you should avoid leaning all the way forward. 
    With your fingers pointing towards your pelvis and your wrists in a vulnerable position, leaning the head toward the ground may cause harm to your bones. 
    Remain in an upright position as you find a balance between leaning forward and backward.
    
    Don’t lift your legs dramatically
    When shifting your body weight to your arms, it’s tempting to lift up quickly and all at once. However, this increases the risk that you will lose 
    balance and potentially injure your wrists. Instead, lift one foot at a time. Make small shifts that allow your upper body to adjust before entering 
    into the final pose.
    
    Release the pose safely
    Like take off, you’ll want to return to the floor gently instead of eagerly. Releasing the pose all at once may cause you to fall onto the floor. 
    Release the pose gracefully and safely by lowering one foot at a time and shifting the weight off of your wrists and onto your lower body.]]}

    Exhale and bend your knees, then lift your feet off the floor, so that the thighs are angled about 45-50 degrees relative to the floor. 
    Lengthen your tailbone into the floor and lift your pubis toward your navel. If possible, slowly straighten your knees, raising the tips 
    of your toes slightly above the level of your eyes. If this isn't possible remain with your knees bent, perhaps lifting the shins parallel to the floor.

    Step 1
    Begin standing at the top of your mat. Exhale to fold forward from the hips. Keeping length in the front of your torso, bring your hands to 
    the floor. Bend your knees as much as needed.
    
    Step 2
    Turn your hands palm face up and slide them under the soles of your feet so that the toes are at the wrist joint. Shift the weight of your 
    feet front and back so that you find the appropriate amount for your hands and wrists.
    
    Step 3
    Once you have secured your hands with your feet, option to draw your elbows out to the sides and up. Keep the back of your neck long.
    
    Step 4
    Stay for up to eight breaths before releasing the hands from beneath the feet and returning to standing.
    
    -----------------
    
    Step 1
    Start by standing in an upright position. Your body should be straight with your kneecaps raised and the spine straight. 
    
    Keep your feet shoulder width apart. Ensure that the thigh muscles are stretched out already as you stand.
    
    Step 2
    From the standing position, lift your hands up slowly to the top as you inhale so that the tips face the ceiling.
    
    Step 3
    With your hands up lower your torso slowly moving the head, hands and the torso as one unit. As you lower, keep the legs straight and the 
    spine elongated and straight.
    
    Step 4
    Lower your body until your nose or chin touches the knees. Your hands should now be touching your toes.
    
    Step 5
    Lift your legs so that you put your hands underneath the arches of the feet. Hold yourself in that position for a set duration or a few breaths.
    
    Step 6
    To release from the pose, slide your hands back out from under the heels of the feet. Move your hands up to your waist and as you support 
    the lower back inhale as you lift your torso upwards.]],

    where you reach for the big toe when in forward bend position.

    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Stand upright with your inner feet parallel and about six inches apart. Contract your front thigh muscles to lift your kneecaps. Keeping your 
    legs completely straight, exhale and bend forward from your hip joints, moving your torso and head as one unit.
    
    Step 2
    Slide the index and middle fingers of each hand between the big toes and the second toes. Then curl those fingers under and grip the big toes 
    firmly, wrapping the thumbs around the other two fingers to secure the wrap. Press your toes down against your fingers. (If you can't reach 
    your toes without overly rounding your back, pass a strap under the ball of each foot and hold the straps.)
    
    Step 3
    With an inhalation, lift your torso as if you were going to stand up again, straightening your elbows. Lengthen your front torso, and on the 
    next exhale, lift your sitting bones. Depending on your flexibility, your lower back will hollow to a greater or lesser degree. As you do this, 
    release your hamstrings and hollow your lower belly (below your navel) as well, lightly lifting it toward the back of your pelvis.
    
    Step 4
    Lift the top of your sternum as high as you can, but take care not to lift your head so far that you compress the back of your neck. 
    Keep your forehead relaxed.
    
    Step 5
    For the next few inhalations, lift your torso strongly as you continue to actively contract your front thighs; on each successive exhalation, 
    strongly lift your sitting bones as you consciously relax your hamstrings. As you do this, deepen the hollow in your lower back.
    
    Step 6
    Finally exhale, bend your elbows out to the sides, pull up on your toes, lengthen the front and sides of your torso, and gently lower into 
    the forward bend.
    
    Step 7
    If you have very long hamstrings, you can draw your forehead toward your shins. But if your hamstrings are short, it's better to focus on 
    keeping the front torso long. Hunching into a forward bend isn't safe for your lower back and does nothing to lengthen your hamstrings.
    
    Step 8
    Hold the final position for one minute. Then release your toes, bring your hands to your hips, and re-lengthen your front torso. With an 
    inhale, swing your torso and head as a single unit back to upright.]],

    Step 1
    
    Sit on the floor with your legs straight in front. Bend your right knee and bring the lower leg up into a cradle: The outer edge of the foot 
    is notched into the crook of the left elbow, the knee is wedged into the crook of the right elbow, and the hands are clasped (if possible) 
    outside the shin. Lift the front torso toward the inner right leg so the spine lengthens (and the lower back does not round). Rock your leg 
    back and forth a few times, exploring the full range of movement of the hip joint.
    
    Step 2
    
    Bend the left knee and turn the leg out. Rock your right leg far out to the right, then lock the knee tight by pressing the back of the thigh 
    to the calf. Next swing the leg across in front of your torso, swiveling from the hip and not the knee, and nestle the outside edge of the foot 
    into the inner left groin. Be sure to bring the right knee as close to the left as possible, and press the right heel into the left lower belly. 
    Ideally the sole of the foot is perpendicular to the floor, not parallel.
    
    Step 3
    
    Now lean back slightly, pick the right leg up off the floor, and lift the left leg in front of the right. To do this hold the underside of the 
    left shin in your hands. Carefully slide the left leg over the right, snuggling the edge of the left foot deep into the right groin. Again swivel 
    into position from the hip joint, pressing the heel against the lower belly, and arrange the sole perpendicular to the floor. Draw the knees as 
    close together as possible. Use the edges of the feet to press the groins toward the floor and lift through the top of the sternum. If you wish, 
    you can place the hands palms up in jnana mudra, with the thumbs and first fingers touching.

    Padmasana is the sitting asana par excellence, but it's not for everybody. Experienced students can use it as a seat for their daily pranayama 
    or meditation, but beginners may need to use other suitable positions. In the beginning, only hold the pose for a few seconds and quickly release. 
    Remember that Padmasana is a "two-sided pose", so be sure to work with both leg crosses each time you practice. Gradually add a few seconds each 
    week to your pose until you can sit comfortably for a minute or so. Ideally you should work with a teacher to monitor your progress.]],

    After bringing the first leg into position, as described above, simply slip the lower leg under the upper and the foot to the outside of the 
    opposite hip. If the upper leg knee doesn't rest comfortably on the floor, support it with a thickly folded blanket. As with its companion, 
    be sure to work with both leg crosses for the same length of time during each practice session.]],
    deepen=[[
    When using Padmasana as a seat for meditation or pranayama, there's a tendency for students to cross their legs in the same way day after day. 
    Eventually this can lead to distortions in the hips. If you are regularly using this pose as a platform for meditation or formal breathing, 
    be sure to alternate the cross of the legs daily. One simple method to help you remember to do this is to bring the right leg in first on 
    even-numbered days, the left leg first on odd-numbered days.]],

    ankles.]],

    Kneel on the floor. Stretch your right leg out to the right and press the foot to the floor, or use a block for extra support if you can't reach. 
    Keep your left knee directly below your left hip (so the thigh is perpendicular to the floor), and align your right heel with the left knee. Turn 
    your pelvis slightly to the right (so the left hip point comes forward of the right), but turn your upper torso back to the left. Point the kneecap 
    toward the ceiling, which will require you to turn your right leg out.
    
    Step 2
    As you inhale, bring your arms out to your sides, parallel to the floor, palms down. Bend to the right over the plane of the right leg and lay 
    your right hand down on the shin, ankle, or the floor outside the right leg. Contract the right side of the torso and stretch the left. Place 
    your left hand on the outer left hip and push the pelvis down toward the floor. Then slip the hand up to the lower left ribs and lift them 
    toward the shoulder, creating space in the left waist.
    
    Step 3
    With an inhalation, sweep the left arm over the back of the left ear. The side bend tends to drop the torso toward the floor. Without pushing 
    the left hip back (continue to roll it slightly forward), turn the upper torso away from the floor.

    Sit on the floor with your torso upright and your legs wide. Bend your left knee and snug the heel into your left groin. Then slightly bend 
    your right knee and slide the heel a few inches toward the right buttock.
    
    Step 2
    Exhale, lean to the right, and press the back of your right shoulder against the inside of your right knee. Lay your right forearm on the 
    floor inside your right leg, palm facing up.

    the straightening knee. When your knee is straight, twist your torso toward the ceiling.

    upper torso further. Turn your head to look at the ceiling.

    Standing Compass Pose – Advanced Version – Begin in the Mountain Pose (Tadasana). Lift up your left leg towards the side. Keep your knees 
    straight. Wrap your arms around your leg (from around your back) and hold up your leg vertically, pointing towards the sky. Put the whole 
    of your body weight on your right leg. Stay in the pose for 5 breaths and repeat. This version facilitates an even deeper stretch than the 
    regular Compass Pose.

    For those with tighter hips — getting your leg up and over your shoulder is a huge accomplishment. Heck, just lifting the foot off the earth 
    and bringing the shinbone parallel to the floor is a pretty big feat. Spend time there.
    
    Holding onto the outside of your right foot with your right hand, lean back onto the support of your left hand on the floor and rock the 
    lifted leg forward and back. Work on bringing your knee back into the space along side your right ribs. Once the knee can pull back beyond 
    your ribs, you’re ready to position the leg up and over your shoulder.
    
    Once you’re able to lift the leg over your shoulder and hold onto the lifted foot with the opposite hand, it may take several breaths, 
    several attempts or several years to straighten the top leg and revolve the torso. And that’s okay. Be patient with your body as you 
    ask it to expand.
    
    Also, instead of bending the bottom knee out to the side you can straighten that leg out in front of you, freeing up the top hamstring just a bit.
    
    Whatever form your Compass Pose takes, allow yourself to enjoy the ride and see where this fun yoga posture leads you. 
    
    Often our emotional experience as we attempt these poses can be our greatest guide.]],

    Revolved head to knee forward bend (Parivrtta Janu Sirsasana)]],
    tips=[[
    It’s good to do this pose in the morning with empty stomach.
    
    Since this is a very complex and challenging pose, beginners are advised to use Yoga Props like straps while performing this pose, also a 
    proper warm-up is required before starting to perform this pose (e.g. Sun salutation sequence or Surya Namaskar).
    
    -------------
    
    Two major misalignments commonly occur during Sundial Pose - the front body slumps down, rounding the spine and low back, and/or the bottom 
    shoulder is forced forward, straining the neck and muscles of the rotator cuff.
    
    To protect your low back, continue to press the grounded thigh bone firmly down, extending your spine up as you attempt to straighten the top leg.
    
    The lifted leg will inevitably push the bottom shoulder forward as you extend the leg straight. Therefore it is extremely important to strongly 
    press the bottom shoulder back into the leg to maintain shoulder integration.
    
    Other key alignment tips: Keep the bottom leg active, flexing the pinkie toe of your grounded foot and engaging the ankle muscles. Also keep 
    pulling your top hand back into the lifted foot through the arm bone, wrapping your top shoulder blade into the back ribs. Lastly, press the 
    base of your skull back, preventing hyperextension in the neck.]]}

    out to the right 90 degrees and turn your left foot in slightly to the right. Align the right heel with the left heel. Firm your thighs and 
    turn your right thigh outward, so that the center of the kneecap is in line with the center of the right ankle.
    
    Step 2
    Exhale and turn your torso to the right until you’re facing directly out over the right leg; as you do this, lift your left heel off the floor 
    and spin on the ball of the foot until the inner left foot is parallel to the inner right foot. Then exhale again and bend your right knee. 
    
    If possible, bring the right thigh parallel to the floor. Keep your left leg active by pressing the thigh up toward the ceiling and extending 
    strongly through the left heel. At the same time, resist the lift of the left thigh by pressing the tailbone toward the pubis.
    
    Step 3
    With another exhale turn further to the right and lean the torso down, placing the left hand on the floor inside the right foot. Dig your right

    floor (if you can’t reach the floor, support your hand on a block). You can keep your right hand on your hip, or stretch it over the back of 
    the right ear with the palm facing down. Then turn your head to look at the right arm. As in all twists lengthen and soften the belly, extend 
    the spine with each inhalation, and increase the twist as you exhale.

    away from the inner foot about 12 to 18 inches. Lean the torso back away from the inner bent leg, as if doing a backbend, and on an exhalation,

    Advanced students will want to keep the back heel as much as possible on the floor. Be sure to rotate the back foot in more than you do for 
    most other standing poses, about 45 to 60 degrees. 
    
    Take a little support under the back heel if needed at first.]],
    tips=[[
    Beginners often have difficulty maintaining their balance in this pose, especially with the back heel lifted off the floor. To improve 
    your balance, support your heel, either by standing it on a sandbag or thick book, or by bracing it against a wall.]],
    partnering=[[
    A partner can help you deepen the twist in this pose. Perform the pose with the outside of your back leg and hip braced against a wall (for 
    the purposes of this description we’ll say you’re twisting to the right with your left leg and hip on the wall). Have your partner sit on the 
    floor outside your right thigh and hip, facing you. She should press one foot against your outer thigh, just above the knee, and the other 
    foot against your right hip (now the pelvis is squeezed between your partner’s foot and the wall). Reach your left arm out toward your partner. 
    She should grasp the forearm and gently tug the arm toward her as she pushes her feet on the thigh and hip. Have her pull according to your capacity.]],
    variations=[[
    You can perform this pose with your hands in a modified Anjali Mudra (Salutation Seal). Perform steps 1 through 4 in the main description above. 
    Press the bent elbow against the outside of the bent knee, but don’t straighten the arm. Then bend the top elbow and press your palms together. 
    You probably won’t be able to touch your thumbs to your sternum, as you do in traditional Anjali Mudra. Open your elbows wide, stretching your 
    bottom elbow toward the floor, the top elbow toward the ceiling. Use the pressure of the elbow against the knee and the palms against each other 
    like a crank to increase the twist in the upper back.]]}

    Step 1
    Stand in Tadasana. With an exhalation, step or lightly jump your feet 3½ to 4 feet apart. Rest your hands on your hips. Turn your left foot 
    in 45 to 60 degrees to the right and your right foot out to the right 90 degrees. Align the right heel with the left heel. Firm your thighs 
    and turn your right thigh outward, so that the center of the right knee cap is in line with the center of the right ankle.
    
    Step 2
    Exhale and rotate your torso to the right, squaring the front of your pelvis as much as possible with the front edge of your mat. As the left 
    hip point turns forward, press the head of the left femur back to ground the back heel. Press your outer thighs inward, as if squeezing a 
    block between your thighs. Firm your scapulas against your back torso, lengthen your coccyx toward the floor, and arch your upper torso back slightly.
    
    Step 3
    With another exhalation, lean the torso forward from the groins over the right leg. Stop when the torso is parallel to the floor. Press your 
    fingertips to the floor on either side of the right foot. If it isn’t possible for you to touch the floor, support your hands on a pair of 
    blocks or the seat of a folding chair. Press the thighs back and lengthen the torso forward, lifting through the top of the sternum.
    
    Step 4
    In this pose the front-leg hip tends to lift up toward the shoulder and swing out to the side, which shortens the front-leg side. Be sure to 
    soften the front-leg hip toward the earth and away from the same-side shoulder while you continue squeezing the outer thighs. Press the base 
    of the big toe and the inner heel of the front foot firmly into the floor, then lift the inner groin of the front leg deep into the pelvis.
    
    Step 5
    Hold your torso and head parallel to the floor for a few breaths. Then, if you have the flexibility, bring the front torso closer to the top 
    of the thigh, but don’t round forward from the waist to do this. Eventually the long front torso will rest down on the thigh. Hold your maximum 
    position for 15 to 30 seconds, then come up with an inhalation by pressing actively through the back heel and dragging the coccyx first down and 
    then into the pelvis. Then go to the left side.]],

    tips=[[
    There’s a middle position for the hands and arms, between having the hands on the floor and pressing them together behind the back.

    bring the right arm around behind the back first; when the left leg is in front, bring the left arm first.]],

    A partner can help you anchor the heads of the thighs, which in turn will help you ground the heels and lengthen the spine. Take the feet apart 
    and turn the torso. Have your partner stand behind you and loop a strap over your groins, just in the creases where the thighs join the pelvis.

    As mentioned above, the full version of this pose is performed with the hands behind the back in Anjali Mudra, a hand position sometimes called

    pashima = “west”; namaskar = “to greet or salute”).
    
    Stand in Tadasana with the hands in Anjali Mudra in front of the heart. Bend your knees slightly and round your back, hunching your shoulders. 
    Exhale, inwardly rotate your arms and sweep them around behind your back. Press the palms together with the thumbs resting on your sacrum, 
    so the fingers point toward the floor. First turn the wrists so the fingers point toward the sacrum, then continue turning until the fingers 
    point toward your head. Your pinkies will now press against your back torso. Slide your hands up your back, lifting and opening your chest as 
    you do. If you can, position the hands between the scapulas, with the pinkies pressing firmly against the spine. Keep the palms spreading 
    together as much as possible. 
    
    Roll the front shoulders up and back, and lengthen down from the back armpits through the elbows toward the floor.

    a couch and hence the name Couch Pose. This pose is a reclined backbend that is done in supine position and is generally categorized as an 
    Intermediate Level Pose.
    
    Couch Pose helps boost energy in the body and hence can be included in flow yoga sequences.]],
    benefits=[[
    Flexibility of the entire leg: Certainly this pose requires some flexibility at the knees and ankles, but going into this pose and practicing 
    it repeatedly helps in flexing the knees and the ankles deeper.
    Stretches the quadriceps: The pose creates a deep stretch at the upper thigh area at the quadricep muscles, and this stretch further improves 
    the flexibility of these muscles.
    Expands the chest and the lungs: In this pose, the chest and the lungs fully expand thus increasing oxygen uptake. This will help in further 
    preparing the lungs for better pranayama.
    Thyroid and Parathyroid Glands get activated: The stretching of the neck in Paryankasana, helps in activating the glands with the fresh flow 
    of blood along with the deep stretch.
    Abdominal area stretches, improving the functioning of the abdominal organs: The deep stretch at the lower and the upper abdomen benefits the 
    functioning of the internal organs, giving room for an improved digestive system.
    Benefits the vocal cords, throat and tongue: Along with the deep stretch at the chest and the lungs, the neck too gets expanded. Along with 
    this expansion, there is fresh flow of blood which works beneficial for the functioning of the vocal cords and throat keeping them free from infections.
    Considered good for someone with low Blood pressure: This pose acts as great therapy for someone with low blood pressure. Repeated practice, but with 
    the guidance of an experienced teacher will prove more beneficial therapeutically.
    Can be beneficial to relieve menstrual pain or PMS: Paryankasana, with the deep stretch at the lower abdomen, can sometimes be of great help 
    to fight PMS. And if this pose is practiced 15 days before the moon cycle repeatedly, one can find a significant change in the body during menses.
    Fresh blood to the brain removes mental stress: 
    
    This pose is said to relieve physical and mental stress with the flow of blood in the opposite direction which works to keep the organs and the 
    muscles alive and fit.]],

    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Begin the practice by sitting at the centre of the mat with the legs stretched out in front of you in Dandasana. Take a few breaths here and 
    raise the spine upwards with the breathing.
    
    Step 2
    Inhale and stretch the arms above your head and as you exhale go forward and reach for the knee with your forehead, while grabbing your feet 
    for support, in Paschimottanasana. Remain here for about 6 breaths to open the lower back and the legs.
    
    Step 3
    Release from Paschimottanasana and bring the spine straight and upwards. Now fold your legs bending at the knees, and sit in Vajrasana. 
    As you sit on your knees and the shin, take a few breaths here and watch for the stretch at the ankles and the knees. If one feels the 
    ankles are not open yet, one could release from the pose and do a few ankle rotations while seated in Paschimottanasana.
    
    Step 4
    Moving from Vajrasana, release the hips from the heels and as you lift the body a bit, move the left leg out and place the folded leg 
    close to the floor near the left hip. And now moving the hips towards the left side slowly release the right folded leg and place it 
    on the floor close to the right side of the hip. Now the body should be seated like in Virasana or Hero Pose.
    
    Step 5
    Adjusting your body a bit at the hips, make sure the hips are centred, while placing the sit bones on the floor, and the spine straight. 
    Move the knees close to each other if possible and throw the feet away from the thighs but close to the hip.
    
    Step 6
    Take a few breaths here to get comfortable with the stretch at the ankles and the knees. For some, stretch would be felt at the thighs too, 
    but that is normal.
    
    Step 7
    Now turning the torso towards the left side, slowly place the left elbow on the floor behind you, and then bring the right elbow on the floor too, 
    behind you.
    
    Step 8
    One could also place both the palms on the floor behind you, taking the torso a bit back ways, and then slowly place the elbows on the floor 
    and balance the body carefully.
    
    Step 9
    Once the elbows are placed on the floor raise the chest up and middle back upwards and go down reaching for the floor with the crown of the 
    stretching the neck backwards.
    
    Step 10
    Once the crown of the head is on the floor, release the elbows and take the arms above your head and interlocking the elbows, place them on 
    the floor behind your head.
    
    Step 11
    While placing the head on the floor, watch for the stretch at the neck, shoulders, chest, ankles and the entire abdomen. Make sure you go 
    into the pose very slowly and carefully.
    
    Step 12
    When your are comfortable with the head on the floor, slowly work on bringing the thighs and the knees together to get a deeper stretch 
    at the thighs and the entire back.
    
    Step 13
    Make sure the chest is opened upwards taking the neck deep backwards.
    
    Step 14
    Remain in this pose, watching for the movement of the body with slow deep breathing. Open the chest to the maximum when inhalation happens.
    
    Step 15
    Remain here for about 6 breaths or more as per the body comfort. And with every inhalation, go deeper into the pose stretching the arms and the chest.
    
    Step 16
    To release from the pose, inhale release the arms first, place the elbows back on the floor besides you and release the head by lifting it and 
    placing it on the floor comfortably.
    
    Step 17
    Remain here for a few breaths making sure the neck and the head is feeling alright, and then slowly with the support of the elbows raise the 
    shoulder away from the floor and lift the entire torso and sit back in Virasana.
    
    Step 18
    Slowly release the legs and stretch them out, and sit in Dandasana. One could move the ankles to release the stiffness and relax the foot.

    pose may be a great challenge for someone suffering from sciatica.

    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Stand in Tadasana (Mountain Pose) next to a wall with your feet hip-width and parallel to each other. Ideally, you will stand forearm distance 
    from the wall. So, as you stand in Tadasana with the wall on your right side, turn to the right and press your right palm into the wall-from 
    wrist to elbow, your forearm should be parallel to the ground. Adjust your distance to the wall accordingly and turn your torso back to center.
    
    Step 2
    Bend your knees into a full squat, with your buttocks sitting on your heels. If you're not able to get the heels fully on the floor, squat 
    with the heels raised on a thickly folded blanket or sandbag.
    
    Step 3
    Swing your knees slightly to the left. As you exhale, turn your torso to the right and press both hands into the wall. As your left hand 
    presses into the wall, the elbow should press against the outside of your right knee. Support the pose by using your right hand for 
    leverage-the right hand will be high and the left hand will be low. For the full pose, it's necessary to close any space between the 
    left side of the torso and the tops of the thighs. So work the back of the left arm down the leg, moving the back of the left shoulder 
    toward the outside of the right knee.
    
    Step 4
    Press the knee and arm (or shoulder) firmly against each other. Use this pressure to lengthen the left side of your torso out of the inner 
    groins, sliding it along the tops of the thighs. There's a tendency in these deep twists to harden the belly, so try to keep your belly soft.
    
    Step 5
    Keep the right hand on the wall or bring the palms together with the elbows angled sharply away from each other. Use the pressure of the 
    palms to increase the twist.

    Rock slightly onto your left buttock, and pull your right sitting bone away from the heel with your right hand. Repeat on the other side. 
    Turn the top thighs in slightly and press them down into the floor. Press through your palms or finger tips on the floor beside your hips 
    and lift the top of the sternum toward the ceiling as the top thighs descend.
    
    Step 2
    
    Draw the inner groins deep into the pelvis. Inhale, and keeping the front torso long, lean forward from the hip joints, not the waist. 
    Lengthen the tailbone away from the back of your pelvis. If possible take the sides of the feet with your hands, thumbs on the soles, 
    elbows fully extended; if this isn't possible, loop a strap around the foot soles, and hold the strap firmly. Be sure your elbows are straight, not bent.
    
    Step 3
    
    When you are ready to go further, don't forcefully pull yourself into the forward bend, whether your hands are on the feet or holding the strap. 
    Always lengthen the front torso into the pose, keeping your head raised. If you are holding the feet, bend the elbows out to the sides and lift 
    them away from the floor; if holding the strap, lighten your grip and walk the hands forward, keeping the arms long. The lower belly should touch 
    the thighs first, then the upper belly, then the ribs, and the head last.
    
    Step 4
    
    With each inhalation, lift and lengthen the front torso just slightly; with each exhalation release a little more fully into the forward bend. 
    In this way the torso oscillates and lengthens almost imperceptibly with the breath. Eventually you may be able to stretch the arms out beyond 
    the feet on the floor.
    
    Step 5
    
    Stay in the pose anywhere from 1 to 3 minutes. To come up, first lift the torso away from the thighs and straighten the elbows again if they are bent. 
    Then inhale and lift the torso up by pulling the tailbone down and into the pelvis.
    
    ----------------------
    
    Step 1
    Sit on the floor with your legs extended out in front of you. Flex your toes back towards your face as you press through your heels. Extend through 
    the spine by lifting your sternum up and broadening across your collarbones.
    
    Step 2
    Hinge from your hips while keeping the front of your torso long and extended. Draw your tailbone back as your sternum reaches forward towards your toes. 
    
    Step 3
    Find more depth by continuing to lengthen the front body and encouraging the sternum forward. If moving toward the connection of forehead to shins, 
    the progression is lower belly to thighs, then upper belly, then ribs and finally forehead to shins.
    
    Step 4
    Allow the breath to move fluidly with you in the pose, using each inhale to lengthen and each exhale to hinge deeper.
    
    Step 5
    Hold the pose for up to 3 minutes before slowly releasing with an inhalation.]],

    Once you are fully in the forward bend you can re-extend the elbows. There are several ways to do this. You can clasp your hands around the

    soles of your feet and grip its sides with your hands.

    Option to sit in a chair with legs extended, then hinge from the hips to move into a variation of seated forward bend.]],
    tips=[[
    Never force yourself into a forward bend, especially when sitting on the floor. Coming forward, as soon as you feel the space between your 
    pubis and navel shortening, stop, lift up slightly, and lengthen again. Often, because of tightness in the backs of the legs, a beginner's 
    forward bend doesn't go very far forward and might look more like sitting up straight.]],
    partnering=[[
    A partner can help you release your lower back in this pose. Have your partner stand behind you facing your back. Perform the pose, then have 
    your partner press his/her hands against your lower back and pelvis. The hands should be turned so the fingers point towards your tailbone. 
    Remember though that the pressure isn't to push you deeper into the forward bend; rather, gentle pressure (parallel to the line of the back) 
    encourages the back spine and tailbone to lengthen away from the torso. Extend the front torso against this downward action.]],

    to by the scientific community as the “second brain.” Therefore, to have a peaceful mind it is absolutely essential that the digestive 
    system remains strong. The pose is suitable for all levels and can be accomodated to fit all needs. It gets its name from the Sanskrit 
    words, pavana, meaning wind, mukta, meaning to relieve or release, and asana, meaning posture. Wind-Relieving pose is part of the

    goodFor={},
    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Perform a modified Adho Muhka Svanasana at your yoga wall, with your palms and forearms on the floor. Your fingertips should be right at the 
    base of the wall, and your forearms parallel to each other at shoulder width. This pose isn't quite as scary as Adho Mukha Vrksasana; 
    it has a firmer base of support, and the head isn't as far away from the floor. But it can still be somewhat intimidating. To ready yourself 
    for and secure yourself in this inversion, firm your shoulder blades against your back torso and pull them toward your tailbone. Then rotate 
    your upper arms outward, to keep the shoulder blades broad, and hug your forearms inward. Finally spread your palms and press your inner wrists 
    firmly against the floor.
    
    Step 2
    Now bend one knee and step the foot in, closer to the wall (let's say the left leg), but keep the other (i.e. right) leg active by extending 
    through the heel. Then take a few practice hops before you try to launch yourself upside down. Sweep your right leg through a wide arc toward 
    the wall and kick your left foot off the floor, immediately pushing through the heel to straighten the leg. Hop up and down like this several 
    times, each time pushing off the floor a little higher. Exhale deeply each time you hop.
    
    Step 3
    Hopping up and down like this may be all you can manage for now. Regularly practice your strength poses, like Adho Mukha Svanasana (or the 
    modified version that's the beginning position here) and Chaturanga Dandasana. Eventually you'll be able to kick all the way into the pose. 
    At first your heels may crash into the wall, but again with more practice you'll be able to swing your heels up lightly to the wall.
    
    Step 4
    If your armpits and groins are tight, your lower back may be deeply arched. To lengthen it, draw your front ribs into your torso, reach your 
    tailbone toward your heels, and slide your heels higher up the wall. Draw the navel toward the spine. Squeeze the outer legs together and roll 
    the thighs in. In Pincha Mayurasana your head should be off the floor; hang it from a spot between your shoulder blades and gaze out into the 
    center of the room.
    
    Step 5
    Stay in the pose 10 to 15 seconds. Gradually work your way up to 1 minute. When you come down, be sure not to sink onto the shoulders. 
    Keep your shoulder blades lifted and broad, and take one foot down at a time with an exhalation. Lift into Adho Mukha Svanasana for 
    30 seconds to a minute. We tend to kick up with the same leg all the time: be sure to alternate your kicking leg, one day right, next day left.]],

    Traditionally the palms are placed flat on the floor in this pose. However, it's possible to change the position of your forearms and hands. 
    You'll need a block to brace your hands. You can make the pose slightly easier by pressing your palms flat on the ends of the block, so your 
    wrists are perpendicular to the floor. Be sure to curl your fingers around the back of the block and then touch your fingers to your yoga wall. 
    Press the inner wrists actively toward the floor. Or you can turn your palms up to face the ceiling, with the pinky sides of the hands on the block. 
    This will help you learn about the rotation of the upper arms. Keep the palms lively and the thumbs stretching away from the ends of the block.]],
    deepen=[[
    Advanced students should gradually move away from the wall and learn how to balance without support. Sit on the floor with your legs fully 
    extended and your feet against the yoga wall. Make an imaginary mark on the floor beside your knees, then set yourself up for the pose with 
    your elbows on this mark. Your hands will now be slightly away from the wall. Then kick up, bend your knees, and touch your feet on the wall. 
    If you're in the right spot, your upper arms, torso, and thighs should all be aligned perpendicular to the floor, and your knees at a right angle. 
    Keep one foot on the wall and extend the other leg fully, pushing the heel actively toward the ceiling. After a few breaths, bend that knee and 
    return the foot to the wall, then repeat with the other leg. 
    
    Finally, with an inhalation, try to straighten both legs and balance.]],
    tip=[[
    Many beginners find it difficult to prevent their elbows from sliding away from each other in this pose. Buckle a strap and loop it over your 
    upper arms, just above your elbows. Extend your arms straight out in front of you at shoulder width and adjust the strap so that it hugs your 
    outer arms. Then use the strap in the pose, but think of pushing the arms slightly in, away from the strap, rather than letting them bulge out 
    into the strap.]],
    partnering=[[
    Two partners can help you get a better sense of grounding the pose through the inner wrists. Position your partners at the wall just outside 
    your forearms, and facing toward you, as you perform the pose. Have each of them press down on a wrist with one of their feet. They should 
    start with the foot on the outer wrist and then, as they press down, roll the foot toward the inner wrist, where the grounding pressure should 
    be concentrated. Help them to regulate the pressure, telling them whether you want less or more. Make sure that both partners are pressing with 
    the same amount of force.]],
    variations=[[
    It may not be possible for you to perform the full pose right away. Instead you can perform its halfway variation, Ardha Pincha Mayurasana 
    (are-dah = half), which will help you build up strength and confidence for the full pose. Sit on the floor with your legs fully extended and 
    your feet against the yoga wall. Make an imaginary mark on the floor beside your hips. Turn around, so your back is to the wall, kneel down, 
    and put your elbows on the mark. Then set yourself up for the pose as described in step 1 above. Step one foot high up onto the wall, then 
    push off the other foot and hoist it up along side its mate. Now walk your feet slowly down the wall, until your legs are parallel to the 
    floor and your torso perpendicular. Press the heels firmly into the wall by lifting the tops of the thighs and tailbone toward the ceiling. 
    Stay for gradually increasing lengths of time, starting with about 15 seconds and working toward 1 to 2 minutes. If you are strong enough 
    to perform this variation, you are strong enough to support yourself in the full pose.]]}

    Then, as you lift the upper torso, head and arms, lift the knees as far away from the floor as possible.]],
    tips=[[
    Beginners sometimes have difficulty sustaining the lift of the torso and legs in this pose. Begin the pose with your hands resting on the floor, 
    a little bit back from the shoulders, closer to your waist. Inhale and gently push your hands against the floor to help lift the upper torso. 
    Then keep the hands in place as you do the pose, or after a few breaths, once you’ve established the lift of the chest, swing them back into 
    the position described above in step 3. As for the legs, you can do the pose with the legs lifted alternately off the floor. For example, 
    if you want to hold the pose for a total of 1 minute, first lift the right leg off the floor for 30 seconds, then the left leg for 30 seconds.]],
    partnering=[[
    A partner can help you get a feel for the work in the back of the upper arms. Have your partner stand straddling your torso while you perform the pose. 
    He should then lean forward and press his hands firmly against the backs of your upper arms (triceps). 
    
    You then push up against this resistance. The partner might also, as he’s pressing down on the upper arms, draw the skin away from the shoulders, 
    toward your wrists.]],
    variations=[[
    A challenging variation of Salabhasana is called Makarasana (mah-KAH-rah = often translated as "crocodile" or "dolphin," but literally "sea monster"). 
    The legs are raised in this pose exactly as in Salabhasana, but the fingers are clasped and then the palms are pressed against the back of the head, 
    with the index fingers hooked up underneath the base of the skull. With the upper torso lifted, open the arms out to your sides.]]}

    Related to the cobra pose, the sphinx pose is a more restorative way to stretch and lengthen the spine. 
    Salamba bhujangasana (SA-lumb-aa BHU-jung-AAHS-uh-nuh) is one of the gentlest backbends in a yoga practice, 
    making it a great entry point for beginners and an effective warm up at the beginning of practice.

    Step 1
    Lie down on your stomach. Place your forearms parallel to each other with elbows under your shoulders and palms facing the ground.
    
    Step 2
    Place the tops of your feet on the ground and rotate the inseam of your pants toward the ceiling.
    
    Step 3
    Lengthen your tailbone toward your heels.
    
    Step 4
    Focus on your lower abdomen, drawing your low belly slightly away from the floor.
    
    Step 5
    Hold the pose for up to 10 deep breaths. Exhale while slowly releasing down to the floor. Rest on the floor, head turned to one side.
    
    ----------------------
    
    Step 1
    Lie on your belly, legs side by side. Firm your tailbone toward your pubis and lengthen it toward your heels. Then, rotate your thighs 
    inwardly by rolling your outer thighs toward the floor. This helps broaden and lengthen your lower back and sacrum (the downward-facing 
    triangular bone at the back of your pelvis) to protect it in a backbend.
    
    Step 2
    Reach actively through your toes to the wall behind you. As you move into the pose, be sure to continue lengthening your tail toward your 
    heels to protect your lower back. Your buttocks should be firm but not clenched. While your legs are active, your tongue, eyes, and brain should be quiet.
    
    Step 3
    Now set your elbows under your shoulders and your forearms on the floor parallel to each other. Inhale and lift your upper torso and head away from the 
    floor into a mild backbend.
    
    Step 4
    The final step to building a solid foundation in Sphinx Pose is to bring awareness to your lower belly, the area just above the pubic bone 
    and below the navel. Lightly draw it away from the floor to create a dome that rounds up toward your lower back. This is very subtle—no sucking in, 
    hardening, or rigidity required. This belly lift supports and distributes the curvature of your backbend more evenly along the length of the spine, 
    soothing your lower back and awakening your upper back.
    
    Step 5
    Stay for five to 10 breaths, then exhale and slowly release your belly and lower your torso and head to the floor. Turn your head to one side. 
    Lie quietly for a while, broadening your back with each inhale, and releasing any tension with each exhale. Repeat once or twice more if you like.]],

    steps=[[
    Step 1
    
    Fold two or more firm blankets into rectangles measuring about 1 foot by 2 feet, and stack them one on top of the other. You can place a 
    sticky mat over the blankets to help the upper arms stay in place while in the pose. Then lie on the blankets with your shoulders supported 
    (and parallel to one of the longer edges) and your head on the floor. Lay your arms on the floor alongside your torso, then bend your knees 
    and set your feet against the floor with the heels close to the sitting bones. Exhale, press your arms against the floor, and push your feet 
    away from the floor, drawing your thighs into the front torso.
    
    Step 2
    
    Continue to lift by curling the pelvis and then the back torso away from the floor, so that your knees come toward your face. Stretch your 
    arms out parallel to the edge of the blanket and turn them outward so the fingers press against the floor (and the thumbs point behind you). 
    Bend your elbows and draw them toward each other. Lay the backs of your upper arms on the blanket and spread your palms against the back of 
    your torso. Raise your pelvis over the shoulders, so that the torso is relatively perpendicular to the floor. Walk your hands up your back 
    (toward the floor) without letting the elbows slide too much wider than shoulder width.
    
    Step 3
    
    Inhale and lift your bent knees toward the ceiling, bringing your thighs in line with your torso and hanging the heels down by your buttocks. 
    Press your tailbone toward your pubis and turn the upper thighs inward slightly. Finally inhale and straighten the knees, pressing the heels 
    up toward the ceiling. When the backs of the legs are fully lengthened, lift through the balls of the big toes so the inner legs are slightly 
    longer than the outer.
    
    Step 4
    
    Soften the throat and tongue. Firm the shoulder blades against the back, and move the sternum toward the chin. Your forehead should be relatively 
    parallel to the floor, your chin perpendicular. Press the backs of your upper arms and the tops of your shoulders actively into the blanket support, 
    and try to lift the upper spine away from the floor. Gaze softly at your chest.
    
    Step 5
    
    As a beginning practitioner stay in the pose for about 30 seconds. Gradually add 5 to 10 seconds to your stay every day or so until you can 
    comfortably hold the pose for 3 minutes. Then continue for 3 minutes each day for a week or two, until you feel relatively comfortable in the pose. 
    Again gradually and 5 to 10 seconds onto your stay every day or so until you can comfortably hold the pose for 5 minutes. To come down, exhale, 
    bend your knees into your torso again, and roll your back torso slowly and carefully onto the floor, keeping the back of your head on the floor.]],

    Pregnancy: If you are experienced with this pose, you can continue to practice it late into pregnancy. However, don't take up the practice of 
    Sarvangasana after you become pregnant.
    Salamba Sarvangasana is considered to be an intermediate to advanced pose. Do not perform this pose without sufficient prior experience or 
    unless you have the supervision of an experienced instructor. Some schools of yoga recommend doing Salamba Sirsasana before Salamba Sarvangasana, 
    others vice versa. The instruction here assumes the former order.]],
    mods=[[
    Rolling up into Sarvangasana from the floor might be difficult at first. You can use a wall to help you get into the pose. Set your blankets 
    up a foot or so from the wall (the exact distance depends on your height: Taller students will be farther from the wall, shorter students closer). 
    Sit sideways on your support (with one side toward the wall) and, on an exhalation, swing your shoulders down onto the edge of the blanket and 
    your legs up onto the wall. Bend your knees to right angles, push your feet against the wall and lift your pelvis off the support. When your 
    torso and thighs are perpendicular to the floor, lift your feet away from the wall and complete the pose. To come down, exhale your feet back 
    to the wall and roll down.]],
    deepen=[[
    It's common in this pose for students to press only the index finger sides of the hands against the back. Be sure to spread both palms wide 
    against your back torso. Push in and up against the back ribs, especially with the ring fingers and pinkies. Periodically take your hands 
    away from the back, press the shoulder blades in, and return your hands to the back a little closer to the head than they were before.

    Beginners' elbows tend to slide apart and the upper arms roll inward, which sinks the torso onto the upper back, collapsing the pose (and potentially 
    straining the neck). Before coming onto your blanket support, roll up a sticky mat and set it on the support, with its long axis parallel to the back 
    edge (the edge opposite the shoulder edge). Then come up with your elbows lifted on and secured by the sticky mat.]],
    partnering=[[
    A partner can help you learn to use your back torso to open the front. In Sarvangasana, balancing on the tops of your shoulders, 
    stretch your arms behind you (toward the back edge of the blanket support), approximately parallel to each other. Have the partner then sit down 
    on your support, between your arms, with his/her back pressed to yours. Lean against each other and use the contact to press your shoulder blades 
    deeper into the back, opening the sternum toward the chin. Your partner can also press your upper arms more firmly into the floor.]],

    One of the simplest Sarvangasana variations is Eka Pada Sarvangasana (pronounced ACHE-ah PAH-dah, eka = one, pada = foot or leg). Come into the pose. 
    Stabilize your left leg perpendicular to the floor, then exhale and lower your right leg parallel to the floor without disturbing the position of the 
    left. The outer hip of the down leg (in this case, the right) tends to sink toward the floor. To correct this, turn the right leg outwardly, moving 
    its sitting bone toward the left. Hold the two sitting bones close and rotate (from the hip joint only) the right leg back to neutral. 
    Hold for 10 to 30 seconds, inhale the right leg back to perpendicular, and repeat on the left for the same length of time.]]}

    Step 1
    
    Use a folded blanket or sticky mat to pad your head and forearms. Kneel on the floor. Lace your fingers together and set the forearms on the 
    floor, elbows at shoulder width. Roll the upper arms slightly outward, but press the inner wrists firmly into the floor. Set the crown of your 
    head on the floor. If you are just beginning to practice this pose, press the bases of your palms together and snuggle the back of your head 
    against the clasped hands. More experienced students can open their hands and place the back of the head into the open palms.
    
    Step 2
    
    Inhale and lift your knees off the floor. Carefully walk your feet closer to your elbows, heels elevated. Actively lift through 
    the top thighs, forming an inverted ""V."" Firm the shoulder blades against your back and lift them toward the tailbone so the 
    front torso stays as long as possible. This should help prevent the weight of the shoulders collapsing onto your neck and head.
    
    Step 3
    
    Exhale and lift your feet away from the floor. Take both feet up at the same time, even if it means bending your knees and hopping 
    lightly off the floor. As the legs (or thighs, if your knees are bent) rise to perpendicular to the floor, firm the tailbone against 
    the back of the pelvis. Turn the upper thighs in slightly, and actively press the heels toward the ceiling (straightening the knees 
    if you bent them to come up). The center of the arches should align over the center of the pelvis, which in turn should align over the crown of the head.
    
    Step 4
    
    Firm the outer arms inward, and soften the fingers. Continue to press the shoulder blades against the back, widen them, and draw them toward 
    the tailbone. Keep the weight evenly balanced on the two forearms. It's also essential that your tailbone continues to lift upward toward the 
    heels. Once the backs of the legs are fully lengthened through the heels, maintain that length and press up through the balls of the big toes 
    so the inner legs are slightly longer than the outer.
    
    Step 5
    
    As a beginning practitioner stay for 10 seconds. Gradually add 5 to 10 seconds onto your stay every day or so until you can comfortably hold 
    the pose for 3 minutes. Then continue for 3 minutes each day for a week or two, until you feel relatively comfortable in the pose. Again gradually 
    add 5 to 10 seconds onto your stay every day or so until you can comfortably hold the pose for 5 minutes. Come down with an exhalation, without 
    losing the lift of the shoulder blades, with both feet touching the floor at the same time.]],

    Step 1
    In Savasana it's essential that the body be placed in a neutral position. Sit on the floor with your knees bent, feet on the floor, and lean 
    back onto your forearms. Lift your pelvis slightly off the floor and, with your hands, push the back of the pelvis toward the tailbone, then 
    return the pelvis to the floor. Inhale and slowly extend the right leg, then the left, pushing through the heels. Release both legs, softening 
    the groins, and see that the legs are angled evenly relative to the mid-line of the torso, and that the feet turn out equally. Narrow the front 
    pelvis and soften (but don't flatten) the lower back.
    
    Step 2
    With your hands lift the base of the skull away from the back of the neck and release the back of the neck down toward the tailbone. 
    If you have any difficulty doing this, support the back of the head and neck on a folded blanket. Broaden the base of the skull too, 
    and lift the crease of the neck diagonally into the center of the head. Make sure your ears are equidistant from your shoulders.
    
    Step 3
    Reach your arms toward the ceiling, perpendicular to the floor. Rock slightly from side to side and broaden the back ribs and the 
    shoulder blades away from the spine. Then release the arms to the floor, angled evenly relative to the mid-line of torso. Turn the 
    arms outward and stretch them away from the space between the shoulder blades. Rest the backs of the hands on the floor as close 
    as you comfortably can to the index finger knuckles. Make sure the shoulder blades are resting evenly on the floor. Imagine the 
    lower tips of the shoulder blades are lifting diagonally into your back toward the top of the sternum. From here, spread the collarbones.
    
    Step 4
    In addition to quieting the physical body in Savasana, it's also necessary to pacify the sense organs. 
    
    Soften the root of the tongue, the wings of the nose, the channels of the inner ears, and the skin of the forehead, especially around the 
    bridge of the nose between the eyebrows. Let the eyes sink to the back of the head, then turn them downward to gaze at the heart. 
    Release your brain to the back of the head.
    
    Step 5
    Stay in this pose for 5 minutes for every 30 minutes of practice. To exit, first roll gently with an exhalation onto one side, preferably 
    the right. Take 2 or 3 breaths. With another exhalation press your hands against the floor and lift your torso, dragging your head slowly after.

    your knees slightly bent and slip the loop over your big toes. Lie back and turn your thighs inward, sliding your heels apart. The loop will help 
    maintain the inward turn of the legs.]],

    To help release the brain and quiet the mind in Savasana, take a block and a 10-pound sand bag. After reclining on the floor, position the 
    block on the floor above your head. The block should sit on one of its sides (the height of the block should be about 5 inches), with one 
    of its ends lightly touching your crown. Then lay the sand bag half on the block and half on your forehead. Scrub the forehead skin down, 
    toward your eyebrows. Then let the brain sink away from this weight.]],
    tips=[[
    Often it's difficult to release the heads of the thigh bones and soften the groins in this pose. This creates tension throughout the body and 
    restricts the breath. Take two 10-pound sand bags and lay one across each top thigh, parallel to the crease of the groin. Then imagine that 
    the heads of the thigh bones are sinking away from the weight, down into the floor.]],
    partnering=[[
    In Savasana, it's especially useful to have a partner check your physical alignment. One of the most difficult parts of the body to align on 
    your own is your head. Have your partner sit at your head and observe its position relative to your shoulders. It's common for students' 
    heads to be tilted or turned to one side or the other. The partner should gently cradle your head in his/her hands and draw the base of the 
    skull away from the back of the neck, lengthening the shorter side of the neck, so that both ears are equidistant from the shoulders. 
    Then your partner can lay your head back down on the floor, making sure that the tip of your nose is pointing directly toward the ceiling.]]}

    It is essential to know the right alignment of the body in an asana to avoid the formulation of any kind of injury and to attain the maximum 
    benefits of the asana. Given below are the steps to practice Shashankasana correctly:
    
    Base Position: Vajrasana
    
    Step 1
    Sit in Vajrasana resting the palms on the thighs right above the knees. Keep the eyes closed and relax the whole body.
    
    Step 2
    Inhale and raise the arms above the head. Elbows must be straight, maintain shoulder width apart distance between the arms.
    
    Step 3
    Exhale and slowly move the torso in the forward direction. Bend from the pelvic region not from the spinal.
    
    Step 4
    Keep the arms slightly bent and rest the hands, forehead, and elbows on the mat. 
    
    Arms must be in front of the knees. This is the final position.
    
    Step 5
    Retain the position as long as comfortable. It could be practice from a minute to 5 minutes.
    
    Step 6
    To go back in the base position, exhale and slowly lift the forehead, arms to the vertical position, Lower the arms resting the palms on the thighs.
    
    Step 7
    Relax and take deep breaths.
    
    Perform 3 times increasing the duration gradually.]],

    In the final position, the buttocks must be touching the heels. In the beginning, a lot of people tend to lift the buttocks to touch the 
    forehead to the ground. Move only as much far as you can comfortably without lifting the buttocks and straining the body.
    People suffering from any of this condition should avoid practicing Shashankasana: vertigo, high blood pressure, knee problems 
    or slipped disc.
    Pregnant women should also avoid practicing this asana.]]}

    This is a common yoga pose that stretches your hips and hamstrings and helps build your core strength. It's a relatively simple lunge, making

    Press hips back while keeping the spine lifted. Root into your feet so that your body is lifted, instead of sinking.

    There are a lot of ways to incorporate this pose into a flow that will work your core strength. For instance, try stepping back and forth to 
    Skandasana from Mountain Pose at the front of your mat without using your hands on the floor.
    
    Once you can comfortably lift your hands from the floor as described above, you can start working towards a bind with the arms.

    Skandasana here is a deep side lunge. It is not the only yoga pose that goes by that name, however. In "Light on Yoga," B.K.S. Iyengar demonstrates 
    a very different pose that is also called Skandasana. This is a seated forward bend with one foot hooked behind your head.
    
    A standing version of this same pose (forward bend with the foot behind the head) is included in Ashtanga yoga's challenging third series. 
    In this, it was apparently also called Skandasana by Pattabhi Jois. Those two poses have enough in common to be considered variations from

    Eye of the Needle is a supine (lying-down) yoga pose that relieves stiffness in the outer hips and lower back. If you spend a lot of time

    school, or in a car or airplane.
    
    This pose also goes by other English names, including "Knee to Ankle Pose", "Reclining One-Legged Pigeon," and "Dead Pigeon Pose." 
    It is often taught near the end of a yoga class as a relaxing way to soothe and open the spine, hips, and low back.]],
    benefits=[[
    This pose stretches and opens the outer hips and low back, which increases the range of motion in the lower body. It also improves circulation 
    throughout the legs, hips, and back, which can help reduce pain caused by stiffness and inactivity. In addition, this pose can help you keep 
    the entire low back limber. It is a soothing counter-pose to backbends and spinal twists. Drawing your limbs in toward your torso causes your 
    mind to naturally turn inward, which helps calm your thoughts, relieve stress, and soothe anxiety. Eye of the Needle Pose also increases blood 
    flow to the pelvis and surrounding organs, which helps reduce digestive discomforts and menstrual pain in women.]],

    Practicing Eye of the Needle Pose is a gentle way to regain balance and equilibrium, especially after a long day of sitting. As you release

    Step 1
    Fold a thick blanket or two into a firm support about six inches high. Sit close to one edge of this support and stretch your legs out in 
    front of your torso on the floor in Dandasana (Staff Pose).
    
    Step 2
    Cross your shins, widen your knees, and slip each foot beneath the opposite knee as you bend your knees and fold the legs in toward your torso.
    
    Step 3
    Relax the feet so their outer edges rest comfortably on the floor and the inner arches settle just below the opposite shin. You'll know you 
    have the basic leg fold of Sukhasana when you look down and see a triangle, its three sides formed by the two thighs and the crossed shins. 
    Don't confuse this position with that of other classic seated postures in which the ankles are tucked in close to the sitting bones. 
    In Sukhasana, there should be a comfortable gap between the feet and the pelvis.
    
    Step 4
    As always, you should sit with your pelvis in a relatively neutral position. To find neutral, press your hands against the floor and lift your 
    sitting bones slightly off the support. As you hang there for a few breaths, make your thigh bones heavy, then slowly lower your sit bones 
    lightly back to the support. Try to balance your pubic bone and tail bone so they're equidistant from the floor.
    
    Step 5
    Either stack your hands in your lap, palms up, or lay your hands on your knees, palms down. Lengthen your tail bone toward the floor, firm 
    your shoulder blades against your back to you're your upper torso, but don't over arch your lower back and poke your lower front ribs forward.

    You can sit in this position for any length of time, but if you practice this pose regularly, be sure to alternate the cross of the legs. 
    A good rule of thumb: On even-numbered days, cross the right shin in front of the left, and on odd-numbered days, do the opposite.

    forearms, use your hands to spread the back of your pelvis and release your lower back and upper buttocks through your tailbone. 
    
    Bring your torso all the way to the floor, supporting your head and neck on a blanket roll or bolster if needed.
    
    Step 2
    
    With your hands grip your topmost thighs and rotate your inner thighs externally, pressing your outer thighs away from the sides of your torso. 
    Next slide your hands along your outer thighs from the hips toward the knees and widen your outer knees away from your hips. Then slide your 
    hands down along your inner thighs, from the knees to the groins. Imagine that your inner groins are sinking into your pelvis. Push your hip 
    points together, so that while the back pelvis widens, the front pelvis narrows. Lay your arms on the floor, angled at about 45 degrees from 
    the sides of your torso, palms up.
    
    Step 3
    
    The natural tendency in this pose is to push the knees toward the floor in the belief that this will increase the stretch of the inner thighs 
    and groins. But especially if your groins are tight, pushing the knees down will have just the opposite of the intended effect: The groins 
    will harden, as will your belly and lower back. Instead, imagine that your knees are floating up toward the ceiling and continue settling 
    your groins deep into your pelvis. As your groins drop toward the floor, so will your knees.

    To start, stay in this pose for one minute. Gradually extend your stay anywhere from five to 10 minutes. To come out, use your hands to press 
    your thighs together, then roll over onto one side and push yourself away from the floor, head trailing the torso.]],

    mods=[[
    If you feel any strain in the inner thighs and groins, support each of your thighs on a block or folded blanket slightly above the maximum 
    stretch of the groins. Make sure each support, whether a block or blanket, is the same height. Continue sinking the groins into the pelvis. 
    To assist this action, lay a 10-pound sandbag across each inner groin, right where the thigh joins the pelvis (the bags will form a "V" with 
    its apex at your pubis). But don't use the bags unless your thighs are supported.]],
    deepen=[[
    You can also involve your arms in this pose. Inhale and raise your arms toward the ceiling, parallel to each other and perpendicular to the floor. 
    Rock back and forth a few times, further broadening the shoulder blades across your back. Then inhale again and stretch your arms overhead, on the 
    floor, palms up toward the ceiling. Rotate your arms so the outer armpits roll toward the ceiling and pull your shoulder blades down your back toward 
    your tailbone.]],
    tips=[[
    Another way to deal with strain in the inner thighs and groins is to raise the feet slightly off the floor. Use a block padded with a sticky mat 
    and lay the outside edges of your feet parallel to the long axis of the block's top face. If the lowest height of the block isn't sufficient to 
    relieve the strain, turn the block to its middle height.]],
    partnering=[[
    A partner can help you get a feel for the release of the thighs away from the sides of the torso. Perform the pose with the tips of your toes 
    braced against a wall. Have your partner straddle your pelvis, facing away from the wall, and step back until your partner's calves are pressing 
    firmly against the very tops of your thighs. If you like you can reach your arms overhead on the floor, and stretch the sides of your torso actively 
    away from the sides of your thighs.]],
    variations=[[
    You can modify this pose and increase the stretch to the inner thighs and groins by elevating your pelvis off the floor. Bringing your heels to the 
    floor in Supta Baddha Konasana, press through your feet to lift your pelvis slightly up. Position a block under your pelvis, lower your sacrum onto 
    the block, and drop your knees out to the sides again, pressing your soles back together. The block has three heights, low, medium, and high: Start 
    at its lowest height and gradually work your way up the ladder. Be careful with the block's highest height—it can be quite intense.]]}

    -----------------
    
    Knee down twist stretches the back muscles, realigns and lengthens the spine, and hydrates the spinal disks.
    
    ------------------
    
    Physical Benefits
    Supta Matsyendrasana (soop-TAH MOTS-yen-DRAHS-anah) is a gentle twist that massages the abdominal organs, helping the kidneys and liver, 
    facilitating digestion and reducing constipation. It stretches the glutes and back, allowing a release in the hips, and opens tight shoulders.
    
    Energetic Benefits
    Like all twists, this pose is energizing. It allows a lengthening of the spine that creates space between the vertebrae, allowing energy to 
    flow better throughout the body.
    
    B.K.S. Iyengar describes twists as a “squeeze-and-soak” action: The organs are compressed and blood filled with toxins is pushed out, 
    then upon release, fresh blood flows in. 
    
    This fresh blood is carrying oxygen and begins to help heal tissue. This stimulation of circulation to your organs can help detoxify your 
    body and increase metabolism and your rate of excretion.]],

    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Lie supine on the floor, legs strongly extended. If your head doesn't rest comfortably on the floor, support it on a folded blanket. Exhale, 
    bend the left knee, and draw the thigh into your torso. Hug the thigh to your belly. Press the front of the right thigh heavily to the floor, 
    and push actively through the right heel.
    
    Step 2
    Loop a strap around the arch of the left foot and hold the strap in both hands. Inhale and straighten the knee, pressing the left heel up toward 
    the ceiling. Walk your hands up the strap until the elbows are fully extended. Broaden the shoulder blades across your back. Keeping the hands 
    as high on the strap as possible, press the shoulder blades lightly into the floor. Widen the collarbones away from the sternum.
    
    Step 3
    Extend up first through the back of the left heel, and once the back of the leg between the heel and sitting bone is fully lengthened, lift 
    through the ball of the big toe. Begin with the raised leg perpendicular to the floor. Release the head of the thigh bone more deeply into 
    the pelvis and, as you do, draw the foot a little closer to your head, increasing the stretch on the back of the leg.
    
    Step 4
    You can stay here in this stretch, or turn the leg outward from the hip joint, so the knee and toes look to the left. Pinning the top of the 
    right thigh to the floor, exhale and swing the left leg out to the left and hold it a few inches off the floor. Continue rotating the leg. 
    As you feel the outer thigh move away from the left side of the torso, try to bring the left foot in line with the left shoulder joint. 
    Inhale to bring the leg back to vertical. Lighten your grip on the strap as you do, so that you challenge the muscles of the inner thigh 
    and hip to do the work.
    
    Step 5
    Hold the vertical position of the leg anywhere from 1 to 3 minutes, and the side position for an equal length of time. Once you have returned 
    to vertical release the strap, hold the leg in place for 30 seconds or so, then slowly release as you exhale. Repeat on the right for the same 
    length of time.]],

    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Begin in virasana (hero pose). Hold this posture until you can comfortably sit between your heels, knees on the floor.
    
    Step 2
    To lie back, shift your weight to your hands, then to your forearms on the ground. Use your fingertips and palms to support your lower back 
    and begin to release all the way to the ground or the supports behind you. 
    
    Keep your knees in line with your hips.
    
    Step 3
    Lengthen your lower back. Think about drawing your tailbone forward to help your lower back soften toward the floor under you. Lay your 
    hands at your sides like you would for savasana, palms up and fingers relaxed.
    
    Step 4
    Stay in this posture as long as it is comfortable, beginning with one minute and working up to five. When you’re ready to release, use your 
    forearms and hands to return to virasana. Keep your chin tucked and lead with your chest.
    
    -----------------------
    
    Step 1
    Perform Virasana. Exhale and lower your back torso toward the floor. First lean onto your hands, then your forearms and elbows. Once you are 
    on your elbows, place your hands on the back of the pelvis and release your lower back and upper buttocks by spreading the flesh down toward 
    the tailbone. Then finish reclining, either onto the floor or a support blanket or bolster.
    
    Step 2
    If your front ribs jut up sharply toward the ceiling, it’s a sign of tight groins, which pulls your front pelvis toward your knees and causes 
    your belly and lower back to tense. Use your hands to press your front ribs down slightly and lift your pubis toward your navel. This should 
    lengthen your lower back and lower it toward the floor. If it does no’t, raise yourself onto a higher support. Then lay your arms and hands 
    on the floor, angled about 45 degrees from the sides of your torso, palms up.
    
    Step 3
    Sink the heads of the thighbones deep into the back of the hip sockets. It’s alright to lift your knees a little away from the floor to help 
    soften your groins; in fact, you can raise your knees a few inches on a thickly folded blanket. You can also allow a little bit of space 
    between your knees as long as your thighs remain parallel to each other. Do not, however, allow the knees to splay apart wider than your 
    hips – this will cause strain on the hips and lower back.
    
    Step 4
    To begin, stay in this pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Gradually extend your stay to 5 minutes. To come out, press your forearms against the 
    floor and come onto your hands. Then use your hands to lift your torso into Virasana. As you come up, lead with your sternum, not your head or chin. 
    Come out of Virasana in the recommended manner.]],

    and head. Use as much height as you need to make the position reasonably comfortable.

    sandbag and gradually over time increase the weight to 30 pounds or so.]],

    floor, palms up toward the ceiling. Rotate your arms outward, so the outer armpits roll toward the ceiling, and pull your shoulder blades 
    down the back toward your tailbone.]],
    tips=[[
    If your thighs insist on sliding apart in this pose, you might try one of two short-term solutions: bind your thighs together with a strap 
    positioned around the mid-thighs; or squeeze a 2- to 3-inch thick book between your thighs. In either case be sure to draw your inner groins 
    sharply up into your pelvis.]],
    partnering=[[
    A partner can help you get a feel for the proper movement of the top thighs in this pose. Have her stand at your knees, bend forward, and 
    place her hands on your top thighs, which can be padded with a folded sticky mat. She should then press lightly down on your thighs and turn 
    them inward, rolling the inner thighs toward the floor. Tell your partner if you want more or less pressure on your thighs.]],
    variations=[[
    Before doing Supta Virasana you can start with its halfway variation, Supta Ardha Virasana (are-dah = half). To sit in Ardha Virasana, draw 
    just your right leg back into Virasana. You can keep your left knee bent with the foot on the floor, or straighten your left leg by pushing 
    out through the heel. 
    
    Then recline as described above, either onto a support or the floor, following all the cautions. Come out as recommended for Virasana, 
    then repeat with the left leg back.]]

    Step 1
    
    Stand with your feet slightly apart, eyes open. Different teachers have different ideas about the proper way to perform this bandha. 
    Here are four possibilities:
    a) Practice with your torso rounded forward, knees bent, hands resting on your knees.
    b) Learn the bandha first with your torso rounded forward and then, after getting some experience, practice the bandha standing upright, hands on hips.
    c) Practice throughout with your torso upright.
    d) Start the practice with your torso rounded forward, perform Uddiyana Bandha, and then stand upright, with your hands on your hips (Iyengar).
    
    
    Step 2
    
    Inhale deeply through your nose, then exhale quickly and forcibly, also through your nose (or pursed lips). Contract your abdominal muscles 
    fully to push as much air as possible out of your lungs. Then relax your abdominals.
    
    Step 3
    
    Perform what's called a "mock inhalation"; that is, expand your rib cage (thorax) as if you were inhaling, but don't actually inhale. 
    The expansion of the rib cage (without the inhalation) sucks the abdominal muscles and viscera up into the thorax and hollows the belly 
    (some teachers say to actively but slowly lift abdominals, or navel, toward the spine). Because you should always perform Jalandhara Bandha 
    along with Uddiyana Bandha, come into Jalandhara Bandha at this point.
    
    Step 4
    
    Hold the bandhas for five to 15 seconds. Then slowly release the abdominal grip and inhale normally. Perform three to 10 rounds, depending on 
    your capacity, with one or more normal breaths between each round.]],

    backs of the hands on the floor. Extend through your heels in the opposite direction. The opposing stretch of the arms and legs sucks the 
    belly into the torso, shaping it like a water tank or pool. Don't, however, hold the breath; breathe normally, allowing the upper belly to

    Upavistha Konasana is good preparation for most of the seated forward bends, twists, and the wide-leg standing poses.
    
    ------------------
    
    Upavistha konasana (oo-pah-VEESH-tah cone-AHS-anna) is a soothing – or intense – way to stretch your hamstrings and groins. This seated pose 
    will also strengthen the supporting muscles of your spine, improving your posture and promoting ease and comfort in your body.]],

    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Begin sitting in staff pose (dandasana). Slide your heels out as wide as you can comfortably.
    
    Step 2
    Lift your hips up, send your tailbone back, then place your hips back down.
    
    Step 3
    Rotate your inner thighs up toward the ceiling so your kneecaps face straight up. Extend out through your heels.
    
    Step 4
    Press your thigh bones into the ground and walk your hands forward. As you move forward, keep your front torso long and your spine neutral. 
    Bring your hands as far forward as you can while maintaining the length between your pubic bone and your navel.
    
    Step 5
    Hold the pose with long breaths for 60 seconds. Gently lift your torso, then use your hands to bring your knees together to release.
    
    --------------------
    
    Step 1
    Sit in Dandasana (Staff Pose), then lean your torso back slightly on your hands and lift and open your legs to an angle of about 90 degrees 
    (the legs should form an approximate right angle, with the pubis at the apex). Press your hands against the floor and slide your buttocks 
    forward, widening the legs another 10 to 20 degrees. As with Dandasana, if you can’not sit comfortably on the floor, raise your buttocks 
    on a folded blanket.
    
    Step 2
    Rotate your thighs outwardly, pinning the outer thighs against the floor, so that the knee caps point straight up toward the ceiling. 
    Reach out through your heels and stretch your soles, pressing though the balls of the feet.
    
    Step 3
    With your thigh bones pressed heavily into the floor and your knee caps pointing up at the ceiling, walk your hands forward between your legs. 
    Keep your arms long. As with all forward bends, the emphasis is on moving from the hip joints and maintaining the length of the front torso. 
    As soon as you find yourself bending from the waist, stop, re-establish the length from the pubis to the navel, and continue forward if possible.
    
    Step 4
    Increase the forward bend on each exhalation until you feel a comfortable stretch in the backs of your legs. Stay in the pose 1 minute or longer. 
    Then come up on an inhalation with a long front torso.]],

    ------------------
    
    Beginners might not be able to bring the torso forward toward the floor. Take a bolster or a thickly rolled blanket and lay it on the floor in 
    front of you, its long axis perpendicular to your pelvis. Exhale into the forward bend and lay your torso down on this support.]],
    deepen=[[
    Advanced students can help themselves move into the forward bend. Perform steps 1 and 2 in the main description above. Then reach out and wrap 
    your index and middle fingers around the big toes, each pair of fingers secured in place with the thumb. Pull back on the toes as you lean forward, 
    but push actively through the bases of the big toes to keep the inner and outer ankles even. Bend your elbows out to the sides and lift them away 
    from the floor as your torso descends.]],
    tips=[[
    Upavistha Konasana is a difficult forward bend for many beginners. If you have trouble bending even a little bit forward, it’s acceptable to 
    bend your knees slightly. You might even support your knees on thinly rolled blankets; but remember, as you move into the forward bend, it’s 
    still important keep the knee caps pointing toward the ceiling.]],
    partnering=[[
    A partner can help you get a feel for the action of the inner thighs in this pose. Perform steps 1 and 2 in the main description above. 
    Wrap a strap on top of your left hip crease and around the left leg and have the partner, sitting off to your left side, hold the two free ends. 
    She should press her right foot against your sacrum, her left foot against your outer left thigh. Then, as the partner pulls on the strap 
    perpendicularly to the line of your thigh bone, exhale and turn your torso to the right. Feel, as you turn, how the strap drags the inner 
    left groin away from (and so anchoring) the twist. Press your left hand on the floor between your legs, your right hand on the floor outside 
    your right hip. Spend a minute twisting away from the deepening left groin, then release with an exhalation, and repeat on the other side. 
    Finally, perform the full pose as described above. As your torso lengthens forward between your legs, pretend that each inner groin is being pulled 
    away from that movement by an imaginary strap.]],
    variations=[[
    Upavistha Konasana has a twisted variation. From the upright position described in step 1, turn your torso to the right with an exhalation. 
    Press your left hand to the outside of your right thigh and right hand on the floor to the outside of your right hip. With a series of exhalations, 
    walk your left hand down along the outside of the leg. Press the top of the left thigh into the floor to serve as the anchor for this movement. 
    Stop at a comfortable place along the way or, if your flexibility allows it, reach your left hand to the outside of your right foot. Make sure, 
    as you twist to the right and move the hand along the leg, that you don’t shorten your right side; continue pressing your right hand against the 
    floor to help lengthen that side of the torso. Stay for a minute. To leave this pose, exhale and swing your torso back to neutral. 
    Then return to upright with an inhalation and repeat to the left.]]}

    Step 1
    Lie prone on the floor. Stretch your legs back, with the tops of your feet on the floor. Bend your elbows and spread your palms on the floor 
    beside your waist so that your forearms are relatively perpendicular to the floor.
    
    Step 2
    Inhale and press your inner hands firmly into the floor and slightly back, as if you were trying to push yourself forward along the floor. 
    Then straighten your arms and simultaneously lift your torso up and your legs a few inches off the floor on an inhalation. Keep the thighs 
    firm and slightly turned inward, the arms firm and turned out so the elbow creases face forward.
    
    Step 3
    Press the tailbone toward the pubis and lift the pubis toward the navel. Narrow the hip points. Firm but don't harden the buttocks.
    
    Step 4
    Firm the shoulder blades against the back and puff the side ribs forward. Lift through the top of the sternum but avoid pushing the front ribs 
    forward, which only hardens the lower back. Look straight ahead or tip the head back slightly, but take care not to compress the back of the

    There's a tendency in this pose to ""hang"" on the shoulders, which lifts them up toward the ears and "turtles" the neck. Actively draw the

    Shift your weight onto your right foot and slide your left foot in, then lift it off the ground.

    Step 5
    Hold for up to 60 seconds before lowering the left leg to a forward fold. 
    Pause for a few breaths then step the right foot back and repeat on the other side.
    
    --------------------------
    
    Step 1
    Perform Virabhadrasana II (Warrior II Pose), right leg forward. Inhale and cartwheel your left arm up and over your head, creating a nice 
    opening in the left ribs.
    
    Step 2
    With an exhale, twist your torso to the right, pivoting on the ball of the left foot to lift the heel off the floor. Then lean forward, 
    lay your front torso onto the right thigh, and set your hands on the floor on either side of the right foot (if your hands don't rest 
    comfortably on the floor, support each one on a block).
    
    Step 3
    Walk your hands slightly ahead of, and shift your weight onto, the right foot. Then, inhale and slowly straighten your right leg, 
    simultaneously lifting the left leg parallel to the floor.
    
    Step 4
    The proper balance of external and internal rotation in each leg is important, especially for the standing leg. Your left leg and hip will 
    tend to externally rotate slightly, lifting the hip away from the floor and angling the pelvis to the right. Try to keep the front pelvis 
    parallel to the floor by internally rotating the left thigh.
    
    Step 5
    Pay close attention to the standing leg, especially the angle of the knee. The knee will tend to rotate inwardly: Be sure to rotate the thigh 
    outwardly and turn the knee so the kneecap faces straight ahead.
    
    Step 6
    Feel how the downward energy of the standing leg creates an upward movement in the raised leg. Don't focus on how high your raised leg goes; 
    instead, work toward directing equal energy into both legs. You can hold the raised leg more or less parallel to the floor, or try to raise 
    it slightly higher; ideally your torso should descend as the leg ascends. If you're flexible you can grasp the back of the standing-leg 
    ankle with your hand.
    
    Step 7
    Stay for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Then, lower the raised leg with an exhale and repeat on the other side for the same length of time.]],

    Step 3
    Begin to lean back without dropping your head. Keep your chin in close to your sternum. With your hands still on your sacrum, find more depth by 
    continuing to draw your shoulders together, focusing on length and extension of the pose rather than depth.
    
    Step 4
    Once you’ve extended as far as you can, option to reach back with one hand at a time to find your feet. Your hands will rest on your heels if 
    your toes are tucked. Otherwise, they will rest on the soles of your feet.
    
    Step 5
    Draw your front ribs in to keep your belly soft and your spine long. Use your hands against your feet to lift more through your heart and 
    sternum with each inhale. At this point, you can choose to drop your head back or to keep your head supported with the neck in a more neutral position.
    
    Step 6
    Hold for up to 60 seconds. To release the pose, return your hands to your pelvis and use an inhalation to come up, pushing the hip points down 
    for support. Lead with your heart, head coming up last. Sit your hips on your heels for a few breaths to feel the residue of the pose.]],

    Uttana Shishosana is one of the easiest and most basic yoga poses or asanas, making it the perfect one for beginners. It is a combination of 
    two different asanas, the Child Pose and the Downward Facing Dog Pose. It exercises various parts of your body, such as upper arms, shoulders, 
    neck, back, chest, hips, abdomen and hamstrings.
    
    --------------------
    
    An intelligent pose to help lengthen the spine and relieve mental stress, uttana shishosana (OO-ta-NAH she-SHO-sahna), is a hybrid pose — a 
    cross between balasana (child’s pose) and adho mukha svanasana (downward facing dog). Uttana shishosana is a great way to energize the physical 
    and subtle bodies for when you’re feeling fatigued, or when you’ve been stuck behind a desk or in a chair all day. Energetically, the posture 
    has the benefits of increasing both self-confidence and self-love.]],
    benefits=[[
    PHYSICAL BENEFITS:
    Opens the front of the chest.
    Stretches the muscles of the abdomen.
    Stimulates and strengthens back muscles.
    
    ENERGETIC BENEFITS:
    Activates the sacral (svadhisthana) and heart (anahata) chakras.
    Increases self-confidence and self-love.
    Opens the heart for more acceptance and love.
    
    -------------------

    Physical Benefits
    Uttana Shishosana, also known as the Extended Puppy Pose, focuses primarily on the back, shoulders and arm areas. 
    
    In fact, it strengthens the hips and back muscles. However, if performed carefully, it can also activate your abdominal muscles, thereby 
    aiding in digestion, reducing bloating and helping to burn stubborn belly fat.
    
    This yoga pose increases the flexibility of your spinal cord and muscles. It also improves a person’s posture and is an exceptional way 
    to regulate Prana, the life-giving force.
    
    Uttana Shishosana is a great heart opener. It expands your chest, thereby decreasing the tension in the back and shoulder areas. As a result, 
    the breathing capacity of your lungs improves.
    
    In this yoga pose, the blood flows toward the shoulders and the chest. This enhances blood circulation and has a positive impact on the body. 
    The asana also stretches the hamstrings and reduces chronic muscular tension.
    
    Lastly, the Extended Puppy Pose works as a stress buster. It relaxes the body and calms the mind. It also induces sleep and thus 
    helps people who have insomnia.
    
    Energetic Benefits
    The contemporary world is cut-throat and competitive. As a result, many people become pessimistic and end up losing their confidence. 
    Uttana Shishosana, well known for its mental benefits, activates the Heart (Anahata) Chakra. This Chakra gives an extra boost to your 
    self-confidence, and you start feeling more cheerful and optimistic. Furthermore, the asana also makes it easy for you to accept yourself 
    and others just as they are.
    
    In addition to the Heart Chakra, practicing the Extended Puppy Pose also activates your Throat (Vishuddha) Chakra, 
    Sacral (Swadhisthana) Chakra and Root (Muladhara) Chakra.]],

    Step 3
    Depending on your body and neck, either rest your forehead onto the mat, on a block, or bring your gaze forward so that your chin rests gently on the mat.
    
    Step 4
    To deepen the stretch along your spine and through the chest and shoulders, press more firmly through the hands as you isometrically pull the hips back 
    to create traction.

    You can skip Uttana Shishosana if you have stiff arms and shoulders. Also, if you suffer from severe lower back pain, then it is recommended 
    that you don’t practice this pose because it may aggravate your pain and make your back stiffer.

    Standing Hand to Big Toe Pose B is a standing yoga posture that is similar to its "sister" pose, Standing Hand to Big Toe (Utthita Hasta 
    Padangusthasana). Extending the raised leg to the side, instead of forward, deepens the stretch to the hips and pelvic muscles, while 
    further challenging your balance.
    
    Like its variation, this pose goes by many different English translations, including "Side Extended Hand to Big Toe Pose," "Big Toe Side Hold," 
    and others. This pose is usually practiced directly after Standing Hand to Big Toe Pose without lowering the leg. Keep reading to learn more 
    about this challenging posture!]],
    benefits=[[
    Utthita Hasta Padangusthasana B strengthens and tones the thighs, calves, and ankles. It stretches the hamstrings, and opens up the space 
    between the shoulder blades. This pose also opens and strengthens the hips and pelvic muscles. It also tones the abdominal muscles. By testing 
    your ability to balance, this pose requires a calm and focused mind. Learning to balance your bodyweight on one leg, while simultaneously 
    stretching, will help you learn how to remain poised in challenging situations even off the mat.]],

    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Begin standing in Mountain Pose (Tadasana) with your feet together and arms at your sides. Breathe calmly. Focus on the present moment. 
    Begin to quiet your mind.
    
    Step 2
    Shift your weight to your left foot. Slowly draw your right knee up toward your chest. Bring your right arm to the inside of your right thigh. 
    Then loop your index and middle fingers around your right foot’s big toe. Rest your left hand on your left hip.
    
    Step 3
    Straighten your spine. Strongly engage your abdominal muscles and the muscles of your left leg. Straighten your left leg, but do not lock your knee.
    
    Step 4
    On an exhalation, extend your right leg forward. Straighten it as much as possible.
    
    Step 5
    Hold here for a few breaths. If you are comfortable and steady, extend your right leg out to your right side. Keep your fingers locked around your big toe.
    
    Step 6
    Make sure your spine is straight and your shoulders are relaxed.
    
    Step 7
    Drop your right hip slightly, so it is in line with your left hip.
    
    Step 8
    Turn your head to the left and gaze out at the horizon, beyond your left shoulder.
    
    Step 9
    Hold for 5-20 breaths. To release, bring your leg back to center. Draw your knee back to your chest, then slowly lower your foot to the floor. 
    Come back to Mountain Pose. Repeat on the opposite side for the same amount of time.]],
    contra=[[
    Do not practice this pose if you have a recent or chronic ankle or low back injury. Always work within your own range of limits and abilities. 
    If you have any medical concerns, talk with your doctor before practicing yoga.]],
    mods=[[
    If you can't clasp the toes of your raised leg, practice Standing Open Knee until you have gained more flexibility and strength.
    If you can't straighten your lifted leg while keeping your spine straight, try using a strap instead of holding your toe with your fingers. 
    Wrap a yoga strap around the ball of your foot. Hold the strap in your same-side hand and then straighten your leg.
    For extra help with balance, extend the hand that is on your hip out to the side, parallel to the floor with your palm facing forward.
    To support the lifted leg as you gain strength and flexibility, rest your raised foot along the top edge of a chair, table, or ballet barre. 
    You can also press the raised foot against a wall.]],
    deepen=[[
    Utthita Hasta Padangusthasana B will improve your ability to concentrate and focus, even off the mat. Regularly practicing this pose will open 
    your hips, adding grace and poise to your movements. It will calm your mind, and add peace and serenity to your day. Don’t be afraid to fall; 
    simply try the pose again. With dedication, you'll gain all of the benefits of this challenging pose.]],
    tips=[[
    It's more important to keep your spine straight and your shoulders relaxed than it is to straighten your lifted leg. You can keep your lifted 
    leg bent or use a strap if you need to, but be sure your spine stays tall and upright throughout the pose.
    Keep your hips level; do not let the hip of the raised leg ride up.
    Keep your gaze and your breath soft.
    Draw your abdominal muscles in and up to help stabilize your body from the core.
    Keep the knee and foot of your standing leg facing directly forward.
    Focus on the stretch, not the lift! Flexibility will come in time. Instead, center your attention on opening the hip of your raised leg."]]}

    The Science Behind Vajrasana
    
    The Vajrasana is a steady, firm pose, and those who assume it cannot be shaken easily. It is a meditative pose, but sitting in this pose can 
    be quite challenging. One has to conquer the pain in the legs and the unrest in the mind to master the pose and enter a meditative state. 
    One needs to train themselves to sit still and be willing to invest their mind in it.
    
    The Vajrasana regulates blood circulation in the lower pelvic region. Sitting on your legs reduces the blood flow in the legs and increases 
    it in the digestive area, therefore increasing the efficiency of the digestive system.]],
    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Kneel down, stretching your lower legs backward and keeping them together. 
    
    Your big toes and heels should be as closely held as possible. People with stiff ankles can support the joint by rolling a 
    towel underneath to support the ankle arch.
    
    Step 2
    Gently lower your body such that your buttocks are resting on your heels and your thighs on your calf muscles.
    
    Step 3
    Place your hands on your knees, and set your gaze forward with your head absolutely straight.
    
    Step 4
    Turn your attention to your breathing. Be fully aware of how you breathe and carefully observe as you inhale and exhale.
    
    Step 5
    You could close your eyes to concentrate on your breathing and to calm your mind.
    
    Step 6
    Try to stay in this position for a minimum of 5 to 10 minutes.]],

    It is best to avoid this asana if you have a knee problem or have undergone surgery in your knees recently.
    Pregnant women should keep their knees slightly apart when they practice this asana so that they avoid putting pressure on their abdomen.
    Try not to over arch or overuse your lumbar spine to sit erect.
    Those suffering from intestinal ulcers, hernia, or any other problems related to the large or small intestine should practice this pose 
    under the guidance of a yoga instructor.]],
    mods=[[
    The advanced variation of the Vajrasana is the Supta Vajrasana. In this variation, once you sit in Vajrasana, you need to bend backward 
    and place both your forearms as well as elbows on the floor. Then, arch your dorsal spine and neck until the base of your head touches 
    and rests on the floor or is supported with a thin pillow. This asana helps strengthen the muscles in the neck, back, and chest regions. 
    It also expands the chest and relieves lung problems. However, it is important to master the Vajrasana before you try this pose.

    tips=[[
    As a beginner, when you assume this position, it is likely that your legs might begin to pain in no time. If this happens, all you need to do is 
    undo the asana, and stretch your legs forward. Give your ankles, knees, and calf muscles a good massage. In time, with practice, you should be 
    able to go up to 30 minutes comfortably in this asana.
    
    Also, beginners should work slowly and gradually on bettering the strength of the muscles in the lower back before they try to go deeper into 
    the pose or increasing the duration. Once the lower back is strengthened, the strain on the breath is decreased. It is also important to note 
    that if you push yourself more than your body can take, the benefits of the pose are minimized.]]}

    Step 2
    Make sure that the supporting hand isn't directly below its shoulder; position the hand slightly in front of its shoulder, so the supporting

    steps=[[
    Step 1
    Begin by preparing as you would for Urdhva Dhanurasana (Upward Bow Pose). Lie on your back, feet on the floor, heels under the knees, and step 
    your feet a little wider than your hips. Bend your arms and place your palms on the floor by your ears, fingertips facing the shoulders, 
    shoulder-width apart. Pause for a moment to focus and tune in to your breathing.
    
    Step 2
    As you exhale, press your knees away from your torso and lift your hips, shoulders, and head from the floor as you straighten your arms. 
    Widen and draw your shoulder blades toward your tail bone to lift your shoulders and lighten the load on your arms.
    
    Step 3
    Bend your arms and place the crown of your head on the floor between your hands and feet, keeping your elbows shoulder-width apart and 
    directly over your wrists. To ensure that your neck does not become compressed, exhale, press your hands into the floor, and again draw 
    your shoulder blades toward your tail bone. Keep your chest open and lifted.
    
    Step 4
    On your next exhalation, slide one hand past your ear to cup the back of your head, bringing your weight onto your forearm. Repeat the same action 
    with the other arm, interlacing your fingers behind your head (you may be more successful in these arm movements if you lift onto your tiptoes).
    
    Step 5
    With a powerful exhalation, press down through your inner elbows and wrists and lift your chest to raise your head off the floor. As your head lifts, 
    press your inner heels down. Of course, your head may seem glued to the floor; if that's the case, continue to hold the pose where you are.
    
    Step 6
    If you do manage to lift your head, the pose may actually become easier, since this movement allows your upper arms to directly support your weight, 
    easing the demand on your muscles. But be careful not to strain the shoulder joints by pushing them beyond your elbows. Avoid this over extension by 
    keeping your weight evenly distributed between your elbows and wrists, and by not allowing your elbows to slide more than shoulder-width apart. It is 
    absolutely fine to remain in this position, with your head raised and your heels directly below your knees.
    
    Step 7
    In the full pose, however, you walk the feet away from your hands until your legs are nearly straight; then plant your inner feet and exhale as you 
    stretch down through your calves and push to straighten the legs completely.
    
    Step 8
    Place the crown of your head back on the floor inside the cup of your hands, press your elbows into the floor and draw your shoulder blades toward 
    your tail bone to help your shoulders stay lifted. Your middle back will be asked to extend more deeply.
    
    Step 9
    Come out of this asana with great attention. First, walk your feet back under your knees. Remain on your crown and return your palms to the floor 
    next to your ears. Again check to make sure your hands are directly under your elbows. Push with your hands to lift the head and tuck your chin and 
    tail bone in as you roll your spine back down to the floor, tail bone touching last. Consciously slow your breathing down until you are once again at 
    rest and can feel the powerful calm that is the product of balanced backbends.]],

    one of the most revered of all the yoga texts, the Bhagavad-Gita, is the dialog between two famous and feared warriors, Krishna and Arjuna, 
    set on a battlefield between two great armies spoiling for a fight.
    
    What's really being commemorated in this pose's name, and held up as an ideal for all practitioners, is the ""spiritual warrior,"" who bravely 
    does battle with the universal enemy, self-ignorance (avidya), the ultimate source of all our suffering.]],

    steps=[[
    Step 1
    
    Stand in Tadasana (Mountain Pose). With an exhale, step or lightly jump your feet 31/2 to 4 feet apart. Raise your arms perpendicular to the 
    floor (and parallel to each other), and reach actively through the little-finger sides of the hands toward the ceiling. Firm your scapulas 
    against your back and draw them down toward the coccyx.
    
    Step 2
    
    Turn your left foot in 45 to 60 degrees to the right and your right foot out 90 degrees to the right. Align the right heel with the left heel. 
    Exhale and rotate your torso to the right, squaring the front of your pelvis as much as possible with the front edge of your mat. As the left 
    hip point turns forward, press the head of the left femur back to ground the heel. Lengthen your coccyx toward the floor, and arch your upper 
    torso back slightly.
    
    Step 3
    
    With your left heel firmly anchored to the floor, exhale and bend your right knee over the right ankle so the shin is perpendicular to the floor. 
    More flexible students should align their right thigh parallel to the floor.
    
    Step 4
    
    Reach strongly through your arms, lifting the ribcage away from the pelvis. As you ground down through the back foot, feel a lift that runs up the 
    back leg, across the belly and chest, and up into the arms. If possible, bring the palms together. 
    
    Spread the palms against each other and reach a little higher through the pinky-sides of the hands.
    Keep your head in a neutral position, gazing forward, or tilt it back and look up at your thumbs.
    
    Step 5
    
    Stay for 30 seconds to a minute. To come up, inhale, press the back heel firmly into the floor and reach up through the arms, straightening 
    the right knee. Turn the feet forward and release the arms with an exhalation, or keep them extended upward for more challenge. Take a few 
    breaths, then turn the feet to the left and repeat for the same length. When you're finished return to Tadasana.]],

    deepen="",
    tips=[[
    When the front knee bends into the pose, beginners have a tendency to tip the pelvis forward, which duck-tails the coccyx and compresses the 
    lower back. As you perform step 2 in the main description above, be sure to lift the pubis toward the navel and lengthen the tail toward the floor. 
    Then as you bend the knee, continue to lift and descend these two bones, keeping the top rim of the pelvis relatively parallel to the floor.]],
    partnering=[[
    Here's a partnering exercise for this pose, but you need two partners (of approximately the same height) and a thick pole (like a broomstick). 
    As you perform the pose, have your partners stand, facing you, to either side of your torso. It's helpful if you and your partners are similar 
    in height. They should hold the ends of the pole and hold it above your head. Grasp the pole with your raised hands, then you and your partners 
    push the pole up until your arms are fully extended. Imagine then, as all three of you push, that your torso and legs are "hanging" from the pole.]],
    variations=[[
    This pose can be performed with the arms in various positions. For example, go through steps 1 to 3 as described above, except with your hands resting 
    on your hips. Then, once the forward knee is bent, swing your arms around behind your torso and clasp your hands. Stretch your hands away from the back 
    torso and lift your chest. It's acceptable to squeeze your scapulas together at first, but be sure, once the chest is lifted, to push them away from the 
    spine. To leave the pose, reach back with your hands and, with an inhalation, "pull" yourself up, straightening the front knee.]]}

    other, palms up, or on your thighs, palms down.
    
    Step 4 Firm your shoulder blades against the back ribs and lift the top of your sternum like a proud warrior. Widen the collarbones and release the 
    shoulder blades away from the ears. Lengthen the tailbone into the floor to anchor the back torso.
    
    Step 5 At first stay in this pose from 30 seconds to 1 minute. Gradually extend your stay up to 5 minutes. To come out, press your hands against the 
    floor and lift your buttocks up, slightly higher than the heels. Cross your ankles underneath your buttocks, sit back over the feet and onto the floor, 
    then stretch your legs out in front of you. It may feel good to bounce your knees up and down a few times on the floor.]],

    There’s no getting around it, Visvamitrasana (Visvamitra’s Pose) is a hard posture. It requires full body integration and cooperation, 
    flexibility, open shoulders and side body, core and arm strength, and above all, patience.
    
    Some days my body gracefully unfolds into the pose. Other times, I’m more like my clumsy Great Dane who falls over every time he stretches.
    
    When I do manage to make it into Visvamitrasana I feel pretty damn amazing – like I can conquer anything that life might throw my way.
    
    ------------------
    
    Integrate all of the seemingly disparate parts that make up Visvamitrasana and soar into this incredible pose.
    
    ------------------
    
    It's a twist! It's a standing pose! It's an arm balance! The super-pose Visvamitrasana is all of those things and more.]],

    Visvamitrasana has many benefits including building strength and flexibility, opening the side body, and stretching the legs and hips in a 
    way not found in many other poses. It builds mindfulness, full body integration, and balance.

    d) Return your gaze to the front of the mat if you moved it while getting into position
    e) Engage your major bandhas and take a few breaths
    
    Step 3 Grab Your Foot
    a) Shift your weight into your right hand and left foot
    b) Lift your right heel and come onto the toes of your right foot
    c) Grab your right foot with your left hand reaching across the top of your foot to grab the pinky toe edge
