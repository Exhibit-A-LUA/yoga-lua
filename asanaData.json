			"    Do you know Mountain Pose? Flip it upside down and you have Handstand. Go ahead, try.",
			"    ",
			"    Like its inverted cousins such as Forearm Balance and Headstand, a major obstacle to Handstand is a natural fear of falling. So the basic ",

			"    wall directly above you."

		],
		"steps":[
			"    Step 1",
			"    Perform Adho Mukha Svanasana (Downward-Facing Dog Pose) with your fingertips an inch or two away from a wall, hands shoulder-width. If ",
			"    your shoulders are tight, turn your index fingers out slightly; otherwise arrange them parallel to each other. If you're uneasy about ",
			"    this pose, you're not alone. To ready yourself for and secure yourself in this inversion, firm your shoulder blades against your back ",
			"    torso and pull them toward your tailbone. Then rotate your upper arms outward, to keep the shoulder blades broad, and hug your outer ",
			"    arms inward. Finally spread your palms and press the bases of the index fingers firmly against the floor.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 2",
			"    Now bend one knee and step the foot in, closer to the wall (we'll say it's the left leg), but keep the other (i.e. right) leg active by ",
			"    extending through the heel. Then take a few practice hops before you try to launch yourself upside down. Sweep your right leg through a ",
			"    wide arc toward the wall and kick your left foot off the floor, immediately pushing through the heel to straighten the left knee. As both ",
			"    legs come off the ground, engage your deep core abdominal muscles to help lift your hips over your shoulders. Hop up and down like this ",
			"    several times, each time pushing off the floor a little higher. Exhale deeply each time you hop.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 3",
			"    Hopping up and down like this may be all you can manage for now. Regularly practice strengthening poses, like Adho Mukha Svanasana and ",
			"    Plank Pose. Eventually you'll be able to kick all the way into the pose. At first your heels may crash into the wall, but again with more ",
			"    practice you'll be able to swing your heels up lightly to the wall.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 4",
			"    If your armpits and groins are tight, your lower back may be deeply arched. To lengthen this area, draw your front ribs into your torso, ",
			"    reach your tailbone toward your heels, and slide your heels higher up the wall. Squeeze the outer legs together and roll the thighs in. ",
			"    Hang your head from a spot between your shoulder blades and gaze out into the center of the room.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 5",
			"    To start stay in the pose 10 to 15 seconds, breathing deeply. Gradually work your way up to 1 minute. When you come down, be sure not to ",
			"    sink onto the shoulders. Keep your shoulder blades lifted and broad, and take one foot down at a time, each time with an exhalation. ",
			"    Stand in Uttanasana for 30 seconds to 1 minute. We tend to kick up with the same leg all the time: be sure to alternate your kicking leg, ",
			"    one day right, next day left."
		],
		"mods":[
			"    One way to modify Handstand is to brace the crown of your head against a padded support placed on the floor between your hands. A ",
			"    supported head stabilizes your position and is a great confidence booster. But getting exactly the right height can be tricky: if the height ",
			"    is too low, your head won’t be braced; if it’s too high, your neck will get scrunched. Use a yoga block for a base, then pile two or more ",
			"    folded blankets (or a bolster) on top. How high you build the support will depend on the height and the length of your arms. Experiment with ",
			"    different heights until you feel like you have the right one, then position your hands on the floor to either side of it. Walk in from Adho ",
			"    Mukha Svanasana until you can brace your crown on the support and the back of your head against the wall. Then follow the instructions above ",
			"    for moving into the pose."
		],
		"tips":[
			"    Many beginners find it difficult to keep their elbows straight in this pose. Buckle a strap and loop it over your upper arms, just ",
			"    above your elbows. Extend your arms straight out in front of you at shoulder width and adjust the strap so that it is snug against ",
			"    your outer arms. Then use the strap in the pose, but think of pushing the arms slightly in, away from the strap, rather than letting ",
			"    them bulge out into the strap."

		"partnering":[
			"    A partner can help you get a feel for the movement of the tailbone. Position her in front of you as you’re in the pose. Have her wrap her ",

			"    Lifting the head to look at the floor is an advanced movement. Be sure not to jam the base of your skull into the back of your neck. Imagine ",

			"    Flexible Hips & Knee Joints",
			"    ",
			"    While doing this asana, you are required to stand for a reasonable period of time. Besides, the various steps of Half Bound Lotus Pose ",
			"    ensure ample stretching of your hips, hamstrings, shoulders, and knees. This eventually results in extremely flexible hips and knee ",
			"    joints and rather stronger legs.",
			"    ",
			"    Stronger Spine",
			"    When you stand still on one leg or bend completely to perform this yoga pose, a lot of pressure gets created on the back and shoulder ",
			"    region. This movement allows more flexibility to the spine and makes it stronger and less prone to injury.",
			"    ",
			"    Better Digestion",
			"    As you bend forward, the internal organs of the stomach get contracted and result in a better supply of oxygenated blood. Besides, the ",
			"    movement also helps in cleansing the liver and spleen, which further improves your digestive system.",
			"    ",
			"    Better Lungs",
			"    When you put the arm behind the back, the shoulder joint starts getting better blood supply. This leads to the expansion of the chest ",

			"    This challenging yoga asana tests your ability to remain alert and stay calm throughout. The way you try to achieve a balance while ",

			"    may seem sweet and demure with flower arrows and a sugarcane bow, her weapons become sharp and deadly when demons need slaying. All yogis can ",

			"    As with other seated poses, such as Easy Pose (Sukhasana) and Perfect Pose (Siddhasana), Half Lotus is traditionally used for long periods ",

			"    - If the knee of your top leg doesn't rest on the floor, support it with a folded, firm blanket.",

			"    - For those with very tight hips, practice the pose seated in a chair. Leaving one foot flat on the floor, cross the opposite ankle into ",

			"    If you are practicing the pose for an extended period, such as in a meditation or pranayama practice, you have a few options:",

			"    a) Set a timer; then change the cross of your legs halfway through your practice.",
			"    b) Practice with a different leg on top each day. This usually works best if you practice the pose every day.",

			"    used at the beginning.",
			"    ",
			"    Take it slowly.",

			"    Step 4",
			"    Keeping your shoulders fixed in this position as best you can, exhale to press your top leg down onto your arm to lift your hips. Kick your ",
			"    heels forward to straighten your legs as you squeeze your left arm with both thighs (think ThighMaster!). If you squeeze the inner thighs ",
			"    powerfully, these actions alone should float you into the pose. (Note that the bottom leg tends to lag, so squeeze it firmly against the ",
			"    upper arm.) It’s OK if the weight of the legs pushes the shoulders down—just actively move the shoulders back enough to prevent them from ",

			"    Peacock Pose is an advanced yoga pose because it requires upper body strength and balance. If you can’t lift up your legs while remaining ",

			"    just need more practice on improving balance.",
			"    ",

			"    ",
			"    Don’t lift your legs dramatically",
			"    When shifting your body weight to your arms, it’s tempting to lift up quickly and all at once. However, this increases the risk that you will lose ",

			"    into the final pose.",
			"    ",

			"    and lift the top of the sternum toward the ceiling as the top thighs descend.",

			"    Step 2",
			"    ",
			"    Draw the inner groins deep into the pelvis. Inhale, and keeping the front torso long, lean forward from the hip joints, not the waist. ",
			"    Lengthen the tailbone away from the back of your pelvis. If possible take the sides of the feet with your hands, thumbs on the soles, ",
			"    elbows fully extended; if this isn't possible, loop a strap around the foot soles, and hold the strap firmly. Be sure your elbows are straight, not bent.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 3",
			"    ",
			"    When you are ready to go further, don't forcefully pull yourself into the forward bend, whether your hands are on the feet or holding the strap. ",
			"    Always lengthen the front torso into the pose, keeping your head raised. If you are holding the feet, bend the elbows out to the sides and lift ",
			"    them away from the floor; if holding the strap, lighten your grip and walk the hands forward, keeping the arms long. The lower belly should touch ",
			"    the thighs first, then the upper belly, then the ribs, and the head last.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 4",
			"    ",
			"    With each inhalation, lift and lengthen the front torso just slightly; with each exhalation release a little more fully into the forward bend. ",

			"    ----------------------",

			"    the spine by lifting your sternum up and broadening across your collarbones.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 2",
			"    Hinge from your hips while keeping the front of your torso long and extended. Draw your tailbone back as your sternum reaches forward towards your toes. ",
			"    ",
			"    Step 3",
			"    Find more depth by continuing to lengthen the front body and encouraging the sternum forward. If moving toward the connection of forehead to shins, ",

			"    it has a firmer base of support, and the head isn't as far away from the floor. But it can still be somewhat intimidating. To ready yourself ",
			"    for and secure yourself in this inversion, firm your shoulder blades against your back torso and pull them toward your tailbone. Then rotate ",
			"    your upper arms outward, to keep the shoulder blades broad, and hug your forearms inward. Finally spread your palms and press your inner wrists ",

			"    the wall and kick your left foot off the floor, immediately pushing through the heel to straighten the leg. Hop up and down like this several ",
			"    times, each time pushing off the floor a little higher. Exhale deeply each time you hop.",

			"    Step 3",
			"    Hopping up and down like this may be all you can manage for now. Regularly practice your strength poses, like Adho Mukha Svanasana (or the ",
			"    modified version that's the beginning position here) and Chaturanga Dandasana. Eventually you'll be able to kick all the way into the pose. ",
			"    At first your heels may crash into the wall, but again with more practice you'll be able to swing your heels up lightly to the wall.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 4",
			"    If your armpits and groins are tight, your lower back may be deeply arched. To lengthen it, draw your front ribs into your torso, reach your ",
			"    tailbone toward your heels, and slide your heels higher up the wall. Draw the navel toward the spine. Squeeze the outer legs together and roll ",
			"    the thighs in. In Pincha Mayurasana your head should be off the floor; hang it from a spot between your shoulder blades and gaze out into the ",
			"    center of the room.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 5",
			"    Stay in the pose 10 to 15 seconds. Gradually work your way up to 1 minute. When you come down, be sure not to sink onto the shoulders. ",

			"    Step 1",
			"    In Savasana it's essential that the body be placed in a neutral position. Sit on the floor with your knees bent, feet on the floor, and lean ",
			"    back onto your forearms. Lift your pelvis slightly off the floor and, with your hands, push the back of the pelvis toward the tailbone, then ",
			"    return the pelvis to the floor. Inhale and slowly extend the right leg, then the left, pushing through the heels. Release both legs, softening ",
			"    the groins, and see that the legs are angled evenly relative to the mid-line of the torso, and that the feet turn out equally. Narrow the front ",
			"    pelvis and soften (but don't flatten) the lower back.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 2",
			"    With your hands lift the base of the skull away from the back of the neck and release the back of the neck down toward the tailbone. ",
			"    If you have any difficulty doing this, support the back of the head and neck on a folded blanket. Broaden the base of the skull too, ",
			"    and lift the crease of the neck diagonally into the center of the head. Make sure your ears are equidistant from your shoulders.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 3",
			"    Reach your arms toward the ceiling, perpendicular to the floor. Rock slightly from side to side and broaden the back ribs and the ",
			"    shoulder blades away from the spine. Then release the arms to the floor, angled evenly relative to the mid-line of torso. Turn the ",
			"    arms outward and stretch them away from the space between the shoulder blades. Rest the backs of the hands on the floor as close ",
			"    as you comfortably can to the index finger knuckles. Make sure the shoulder blades are resting evenly on the floor. Imagine the ",
			"    lower tips of the shoulder blades are lifting diagonally into your back toward the top of the sternum. From here, spread the collarbones.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 4",
			"    In addition to quieting the physical body in Savasana, it's also necessary to pacify the sense organs. ",
			"    ",
			"    Soften the root of the tongue, the wings of the nose, the channels of the inner ears, and the skin of the forehead, especially around the ",
			"    bridge of the nose between the eyebrows. Let the eyes sink to the back of the head, then turn them downward to gaze at the heart. ",
			"    Release your brain to the back of the head.",

			"    Stay in this pose for 5 minutes for every 30 minutes of practice. To exit, first roll gently with an exhalation onto one side, preferably ",

		"tips":[
			"    Often it's difficult to release the heads of the thigh bones and soften the groins in this pose. This creates tension throughout the body and ",

			"    Pregnancy: Raise your head and chest on a bolster."
		],
		"partnering":[
			"    In Savasana, it's especially useful to have a partner check your physical alignment. One of the most difficult parts of the body to align on ",
			"    your own is your head. Have your partner sit at your head and observe its position relative to your shoulders. It's common for students' ",
			"    heads to be tilted or turned to one side or the other. The partner should gently cradle your head in his/her hands and draw the base of the ",
			"    skull away from the back of the neck, lengthening the shorter side of the neck, so that both ears are equidistant from the shoulders. ",

			"    To help release the brain and quiet the mind in Savasana, take a block and a 10-pound sand bag. After reclining on the floor, position the ",

			"    Eye of the Needle is a supine (lying-down) yoga pose that relieves stiffness in the outer hips and lower back. If you spend a lot of time ",
			"    sitting, those muscles become tight and short due to the lack of use. This pose can feel great at the end of a long day of sitting at work, ",
			"    school, or in a car or airplane.",
			"    ",
			"    This pose also goes by other English names, including 'Knee to Ankle Pose', 'Reclining One-Legged Pigeon', and 'Dead Pigeon Pose'. ",
			"    It is often taught near the end of a yoga class as a relaxing way to soothe and open the spine, hips, and low back."
		],
		"benefits":[
			"    This pose stretches and opens the outer hips and low back, which increases the range of motion in the lower body. It also improves circulation ",
			"    throughout the legs, hips, and back, which can help reduce pain caused by stiffness and inactivity. In addition, this pose can help you keep ",
			"    the entire low back limber. It is a soothing counter-pose to backbends and spinal twists. Drawing your limbs in toward your torso causes your ",
			"    mind to naturally turn inward, which helps calm your thoughts, relieve stress, and soothe anxiety. Eye of the Needle Pose also increases blood ",
			"    flow to the pelvis and surrounding organs, which helps reduce digestive discomforts and menstrual pain in women."
		],
		"steps":[
			"    Step 1",
			"    Begin by lying on your back with your legs extended and your arms resting alongside your body.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 2",
			"    Bend your knees, placing the soles of your feet flat on the floor. Separate your feet so they are hip-width apart. ",
			"    Your thighs should be parallel to each other.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 3",
			"    Straighten your left leg upward, extending your heel toward the ceiling. Then bend your left knee and cross your left ankle over your right ",
			"    knee. Bring your left, outer ankle to the outside of your right knee so your foot hovers in the air. Then flex your left foot, actively ",
			"    pressing through your heel while simultaneously pulling your toes back toward the left.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 4",
			"    On an exhalation, draw your right knee in toward your chest. Slide your left hand and forearm through the space between your legs and clasp ",
			"    both hands around the back of your right leg’s thigh. If it is possible for you, hold onto your shin, instead.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 5",
			"    Keep your back flat on the mat. Release your shoulder blades down toward your waist. ",
			"    ",
			"    Broaden across your collarbones.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 6",
			"    Draw your tailbone and sacrum down toward the mat, lengthening your spine even more.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 7",
			"    Tuck your chin slightly and gaze down the center line of your body.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 8",
			"    Hold for up to one minute. Keep your breath smooth and even.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 9",
			"    With an exhalation, release your leg and place your right foot on the floor. Extend your left leg straight up to the ceiling again, and then ",

		"mods":[
			"    Eye of the Needle Pose is a calming stretch that can prepare your body for deeper rest and relaxation. There should be no pain and very little ",
			"    discomfort when practiced. If you need to modify the pose to make it more comfortable, try these simple changes to find a variation that works ",
			"    best for you:",
			"    ",
			"    If it is difficult to clasp your bottom thigh, use a yoga strap. Wrap the strap around the back of your thigh and hold each end of the strap ",
			"    with your hands.",
			"    ",
			"    To lessen the intensity of the stretch, bring the knee of your top leg further away from the side of your body. To deepen the stretch, ",
			"    bring your knee closer to the midline of your body.",
			"    ",
			"    If your stomach or chest is large, it might be difficult to clasp both hands around your thigh. Instead, draw your bottom leg slightly to the ",
			"    side of your body, toward its same-side armpit. Hold onto your thigh or shin with the same-side hand, and gently rest your opposite-side hand ",
			"    on your top leg's knee."
		],
		"tips":[
			"    Keep your spine lengthening along the floor all the way through your tailbone. Resist the tendency to let your buttocks and hips lift off the mat. ",
			"    It is more important to have a long spine than to draw your knees tightly in toward your chest.",
			"",
			"    If you have any discomfort in your head or neck, place a firm blanket under your head.",
			"    ",
			"    Practicing Eye of the Needle Pose is a gentle way to regain balance and equilibrium, especially after a long day of sitting. As you release ",
			"    excess tension and stretch out the muscles of your hips and low back, your mind will naturally begin to release stress. Practice this pose ",
			"    in the morning to help your body transition from sleeping to waking. Practicing it before bed will help you relax before slumber. ",
			"    It's a simple way to help your body, mind, and spirit stay balanced and calm throughout the day."
		],
		"contra":[
			"    Knee, back, or hip injuries",
			"    ",
			"    Avoid practicing this pose if you have a recent or chronic injury to your knees, hips, low back, or spine. Those with back pain, ",
			"    back injuries, or degenerative disk disease should approach this pose with caution, and should only attempt to practice it under ",
			"    the guidance of an experienced and knowledgeable instructor. Women who are pregnant should not practice this pose after the first ",

			"    Next slide your hands along your outer thighs from the hips toward the knees and widen your outer knees away from your hips. Then slide your ",

			"    ",
			"    Step 3",
			"    ",
			"    The natural tendency in this pose is to push the knees toward the floor in the belief that this will increase the stretch of the inner thighs ",
			"    and groins. But especially if your groins are tight, pushing the knees down will have just the opposite of the intended effect: The groins ",
			"    will harden, as will your belly and lower back. Instead, imagine that your knees are floating up toward the ceiling and continue settling ",
			"    your groins deep into your pelvis. As your groins drop toward the floor, so will your knees.",

			"    Keep your knees in line with your hips.",

			"    Uttana Shishosana is one of the easiest and most basic yoga poses or asanas, making it the perfect one for beginners. It is a combination of ",

			"    neck, back, chest, hips, abdomen and hamstrings.",

			"    --------------------",
			"    ",
			"    An intelligent pose to help lengthen the spine and relieve mental stress, uttana shishosana (OO-ta-NAH she-SHO-sahna), is a hybrid pose — a ",

			"    and subtle bodies for when you’re feeling fatigued, or when you’ve been stuck behind a desk or in a chair all day. Energetically, the posture ",
			"    has the benefits of increasing both self-confidence and self-love."

			"    Physical Benefits",
			"    Uttana Shishosana, also known as the Extended Puppy Pose, focuses primarily on the back, shoulders and arm areas. ",
			"    ",
			"    In fact, it strengthens the hips and back muscles. However, if performed carefully, it can also activate your abdominal muscles, thereby ",
			"    aiding in digestion, reducing bloating and helping to burn stubborn belly fat.",
			"    ",
			"    This yoga pose increases the flexibility of your spinal cord and muscles. It also improves a person’s posture and is an exceptional way ",
			"    to regulate Prana, the life-giving force.",
			"    ",
			"    Uttana Shishosana is a great heart opener. It expands your chest, thereby decreasing the tension in the back and shoulder areas. As a result, ",
			"    the breathing capacity of your lungs improves.",
			"    ",
			"    In this yoga pose, the blood flows toward the shoulders and the chest. This enhances blood circulation and has a positive impact on the body. ",
			"    The asana also stretches the hamstrings and reduces chronic muscular tension.",
			"    ",
			"    Lastly, the Extended Puppy Pose works as a stress buster. It relaxes the body and calms the mind. It also induces sleep and thus ",
			"    helps people who have insomnia.",
			"    ",
			"    Energetic Benefits",
			"    The contemporary world is cut-throat and competitive. As a result, many people become pessimistic and end up losing their confidence. ",
			"    Uttana Shishosana, well known for its mental benefits, activates the Heart (Anahata) Chakra. This Chakra gives an extra boost to your ",
			"    self-confidence, and you start feeling more cheerful and optimistic. Furthermore, the asana also makes it easy for you to accept yourself ",
			"    and others just as they are.",
			"    ",
			"    In addition to the Heart Chakra, practicing the Extended Puppy Pose also activates your Throat (Vishuddha) Chakra, ",
			"    Sacral (Swadhisthana) Chakra and Root (Muladhara) Chakra."

			"    your feet a little wider than your hips. Bend your arms and place your palms on the floor by your ears, fingertips facing the shoulders, ",
			"    shoulder-width apart. Pause for a moment to focus and tune in to your breathing.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 2",
			"    As you exhale, press your knees away from your torso and lift your hips, shoulders, and head from the floor as you straighten your arms. ",
			"    Widen and draw your shoulder blades toward your tail bone to lift your shoulders and lighten the load on your arms.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 3",
			"    Bend your arms and place the crown of your head on the floor between your hands and feet, keeping your elbows shoulder-width apart and ",
			"    directly over your wrists. To ensure that your neck does not become compressed, exhale, press your hands into the floor, and again draw ",
			"    your shoulder blades toward your tail bone. Keep your chest open and lifted.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 4",
			"    On your next exhalation, slide one hand past your ear to cup the back of your head, bringing your weight onto your forearm. Repeat the same action ",
			"    with the other arm, interlacing your fingers behind your head (you may be more successful in these arm movements if you lift onto your tiptoes).",
			"    ",
			"    Step 5",
			"    With a powerful exhalation, press down through your inner elbows and wrists and lift your chest to raise your head off the floor. As your head lifts, ",
			"    press your inner heels down. Of course, your head may seem glued to the floor; if that's the case, continue to hold the pose where you are.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 6",
			"    If you do manage to lift your head, the pose may actually become easier, since this movement allows your upper arms to directly support your weight, ",
			"    easing the demand on your muscles. But be careful not to strain the shoulder joints by pushing them beyond your elbows. Avoid this over extension by ",
			"    keeping your weight evenly distributed between your elbows and wrists, and by not allowing your elbows to slide more than shoulder-width apart. It is ",
			"    absolutely fine to remain in this position, with your head raised and your heels directly below your knees.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 7",
			"    In the full pose, however, you walk the feet away from your hands until your legs are nearly straight; then plant your inner feet and exhale as you ",
			"    stretch down through your calves and push to straighten the legs completely.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 8",
			"    Place the crown of your head back on the floor inside the cup of your hands, press your elbows into the floor and draw your shoulder blades toward ",
			"    your tail bone to help your shoulders stay lifted. Your middle back will be asked to extend more deeply.",
			"    ",
			"    Step 9",
			"    Come out of this asana with great attention. First, walk your feet back under your knees. Remain on your crown and return your palms to the floor ",
			"    next to your ears. Again check to make sure your hands are directly under your elbows. Push with your hands to lift the head and tuck your chin and ",
			"    tail bone in as you roll your spine back down to the floor, tail bone touching last. Consciously slow your breathing down until you are once again at ",
			"    rest and can feel the powerful calm that is the product of balanced backbends."

			"    ",
			"    In the Buddhist tradition, a story is famous where Buddha used this hand gesture when a furious elephant attacked at him. ",

			"    Usually, the energy associated with our fingers is dissipated into the environment. When fingers in a yoga mudra come in contact ",

			"",
			"    For elimination in the body, earth and ether elements play an essential role. When there is an imbalance arises in these two elements, ",

			"    Chinmaya mudra is a simple hand gesture that helps to bring supreme awareness to the body.",
			"",
			"    Usually, our awareness is scattered in the outer world through five senses of organs. Chinmaya Mudra is a rejuvenator hand gesture ",
			"    that brings outward flowing awareness back inside us.",
			"    ",
			"    To bring awareness back inside our body, finger arrangement in Chinmaya mudra is designed in such a way that it connects all individual ",
			"    elements of fingers in one place.",
			"    ",
			"    Here, every finger shows some energy association:",
			"    ",
			"    - Thumb–Fire or Universal consciousness",
			"    - Index finger–Air or individual consciousness",
			"    - Middle finger–Ether or Connection",
			"    - Ring finger–Earth or physical sensation",
			"    - Little finger–Water or fluidity",
			"",
			"    In Chinmaya mudra, we touch the thumb with index finger & curl the rest three fingers towards the palm.",
			"    ",
			"    Thus, Chinmaya mudra connects all individual elements of the fingers in one place and unites individual awareness with the supreme soul.",
			"    ",
			"    Through this practice, the awareness of the breath and the prana energy flows smoothly through the body, helping the physical body ",
			"    to remain in balance.",
			"    ",
			"    Chinmaya Mudra connects us with the soul/energy or awareness within, that’s why we call it Chinmaya Mudra: the gesture of awareness.",
			"    ",
			"    What Does Chinmaya Mudra Represent:",
			"",
			"    Chinmaya Mudra represents our connection with the supreme soul.",
			"    ",
			"    The word Chinmaya Mudra originates from the Sanskrit language. Here ‘Chinmaya‘ means ‘Supreme awareness‘, ‘pure wisdom‘ or ",
			"    ‘full of knowledge‘ and ‘Mudra‘ means ‘seal‘ or ‘posture‘.",
			"    ",
			"    In other words, Chinmaya also means To Dwell On Self Awareness or Soul.",
			"",
			"    Time and Duration for Chinmaya Mudra",
			"",
			"    Still, there is no specific time to do Chinmay mudra, so you can practice it anytime.",
			"",
			"    As this mudra is a meditative mudra, so you need a disturbance-free environment to perform it. In the morning time, there is least ",
			"    noise and disturbance, therefore, perform this mudra in the morning time to get best results.",
			"",
			"    Perform it mudra for a minimum of 10-15 minutes. Then increase the duration of practicing gently for 40-45 minutes once you become ",
			"    comfortable in handling fingers in same position. It’ll bring better results.",
			"",
			"    The most important aspect of this mudra is consistency. Try to do this mudra consistently, you will definitely see the results in ",
			"    very less time.",
			"",
			"    Chinmaya Mudra Vs. Chin/Gyan Mudra",
			"",
			"    We can differentiate Chinmaya mudra from Chin mudra based on two aspects:",
			"",
			"    1. Based on the Motive of Mudra",
			"",
			"    Chinmaya Mudra is a little different from the Chin mudra. Chinmaya Mudra brings the awareness within, while Chin mudra helps to ",
			"    generate self-consciousness.",
			"",
			"    Awareness is not much different from consciousness, but still, we can’t both the same.",
			"",
			"    'Consciousness results from what we see or what we had known, is a part of our Chitta. On the other hand, awareness is what we think ",
			"    and what we are aware of. Consciousness is divided and variable, but awareness is total and invariable.",
			"",
			"    According to a world expert on lucid dreaming, Stephen LaBerge,",
			"",
			"    'Consciousness is awareness plus mind and the structure of the individual brain. That’s a critical understanding, he says. ",
			"    Consciousness has to do with the brain, but it’s not awareness. Awareness is the word for what it is prior to the one thing we are sure of.",
			"",
			"    2. Based on the Formation of Fingers",
			"",
			"    Basically, Chin mudra is a variation of Gyan mudra. In chin mudra, the tip of our thumb touches the tip of the index finger, and the ",
			"    remaining three fingers remain extended and palm facing down. Hands are placed over the middle thighs in vajrasana.",
			"",
			"    On the other hand, in Chinmaya mudra, the tip of the thumb touches the tip of the index finger, and the remaining three fingers also ",
			"    curled to the palm facing upwards.",
			"",
			"    Thus, Chinmaya mudra differs from Chin mudra.",
			"",
			"    How Does Chinmaya Mudra Work",
			"",
			"    We know, the tip of each finger associate some nerves. Chinmaya Mudra includes gentle pressure in tips of each finger.",
			"",
			"    The pressure helps in the stimulation of nerves, resulting in a better nervous system. A better nervous system leads to good ",
			"    mental and physical health.",
			"",
			"    The air element is especially beneficial for the function of the brain.",
			"",
			"    Our index finger is associated with the energy of the air element. In this mudra, the index finger comes in contact with the ",
			"    thumb (fire element).",
			"",
			"    The contact of the thumb and index finger makes a closed-loop, which does not allow the element to disperse their energy into ",
			"    the environment. This clears the way of prana to our Chitta and spiritual powers. Thus, the air element in the body gets balanced, ",
			"    which leads to a powerful brain.",
			"",
			"    This mudra also redirects the flow of energy of other elements ( ether, earth and water) associated with the rest of our fingers. ",
			"    This flow of energy keeps us healthy, physically and mentally.",

			"    ",
			"    - Prevents Memory Loss",
			"",

			"    the brain. This relaxes the brain and body. Thus it prevents memory loss.",
			"    ",
			"    - Improves Digestion",
			"",

			"    - Cures Insomnia (Sleep Disorders)",

			"    The term “Jnana” is derived from Sanskrit which refers to “knowledge” or “wisdom”. “Mudra” is also a composite word, where “mud” ",

			"    the thumb represents the Agni (fire) element.",
			"    ",
			"    Jnana Mudra stabilizes the unsteady Vayu elements by balancing it with the Fire and brings stability to the mind. Only a stable ",
			"    mind can achieve wisdom or acquire knowledge, hence it’s named Jnana Mudra – the gesture of knowledge.",

			"    Also, air element efficiency gets increased when comes in contact with fire, hence it’s also called ‘Vayu vardak mudra’.",

			"    - “Sattva Guna“- harmony and luminosity – Middle finger",
			"    ",
			"    Jnana mudra shows one needs to transcend these three traits to transform the consciousness from ignorance to knowledge.",
			"",
			"    The index finger symbolizes individual consciousness (jivatma) thumb represents the supreme consciousness. In Jnana mudra, ",
			"    the index finger-thumb association shows the ultimate unison of two experiences (individual and supreme power) culminating yoga. ",
			"    It justifies mudra as one of the yoganga and also known as the ‘Mudra of wisdom’.",

			"    WHY THIS CAMEL POSE SEQUENCE WORKS",
			"",
			"    Students who love Ustrasana, Camel Pose, praise the pose for the way it opens the shoulders, chest and upper-back. And, they’re right. ",
			"    ",
			"    Camel Pose  is hard to beat when it comes to extending the thoracic spine. Students who loathe Ustrasana invariably complain about ",
			"    discomfort in the neck and lower back. They’re also right. ",
			"    It can be tough to do Ustrasana without creating excessive compression in your lower back and neck.",
			"    ",
			"    As teachers, we know two things about how our students experience Ustrasana. Some students love the pose because it’s working for them; ",
			"    and, some students don’t love the pose because it’s not working for them. For me, this becomes a puzzle to solve when I’m sequencing a class. ",
			"    My goals are clear: I want to create a sequence that helps students maximize the benefits of Ustrasana (Camel Pose) while minimizing the ",
			"    challenges of the posture.",
			"    ",
			"    MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF CAMEL POSE",
			"    To do this, the sequence below emphasizes a flow of postures that methodologically prepares your entire front body for Ustrasana. ",
			"    When the front body—especially the hip flexors, quadriceps, abdominals, pectorals and anterior deltoids—are adequately prepared, ",
			"    it’s more likely that your students will be able to open their shoulders and chest without crunching their lower back and neck.",
			"    ",
			"    Here’s a really quick break down of my favorite mini-practice for Ustrasana (Camel Pose).",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 1-3",
			"    The first 3 postures allow you to settle into your body. Mild twisting is a nice preparation for yoga backbends. The following posture ",
			"    flow is going to focus almost exclusively on lengthening the front body in preparation for backbends, so it’s nice to the sequence ",
			"    with a little complementary work.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 4-6",
			"    I really love this combination of poses and I use it in a lot of my sequences. It’s definitely a staple in my own practice. In each of these ",
			"    postures your shoulder is in extension and one hip is in extension. This simultaneously lengthens the front of your shoulders, chest, hip-flexors ",
			"    and quads. ",
			"    ",
			"",
			"    The top arm is in the same chest-opening position as Ustrasana. These postures also introduce mild spinal extension. This mild backbending segues ",
			"    perfectly into the next combination of postures.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 7-12",
			"    This is a straightforward progression of backbends that goes from less demanding to more demanding. One of the reasons that I chose these postures ",
			"    is that they all extend the shoulder joint, except for Cobra Pose. This shoulder extension will help open the front of the shoulders and chest ",
			"    in preparation for Ustrasana.",
			"    ",
			"    POSE 13",
			"    Lucky number 13—Ustrasana! This is still a tough posture for most students, but here are 3 quick tips for working with the posture. 1) Engage the ",
			"    bottom of your Gluteus Maximus. Yes, engage them. 2) Externally rotate your arms so that your biceps and elbow creases are turning away from each ",
			"    other. This will help lift your chest in the pose. 3) If the pose is still uncomfortable in your neck, tuck your chin and look toward your chest. ",
			"    If the pose is uncomfortable in your lower back, place your hands on the back of your pelvis. Use your thumbs to lengthen the back of your pelvis ",
			"    downward. Take your time and do what you need to do in order to befriend the pose.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 14-15",
			"    The word “perfect” is nauseatingly overused. But, I’m going to add to the problem and write that Supta Padangusthasana is the “perfect” follow-up ",
			"    to Ustrasana and other backbends. Unlike Happy Baby Pose, which flexes the spine, Supta Padangusthasana allows you to maintain the natural curves ",
			"    of the spine. This is a mild transition for your back after all the extension you created in your backbends. It also allows you a few moments to ",
			"    feel (and possibly savor) the afterglow of your backbends. Viparita Karani is your just desserts."

			"    WHY THIS SEQUENCE WORKS",
			"",
			"    I spent my first two years of yoga avoiding Warrior III. Then, I spent another year avoiding it. Finally, after avoiding it for an ",
			"    additional 15 years, I’ve made it a mainstay of my practice. What can I say? I guess it takes me a while to warm up to things that ",
			"    expose my weaknesses, knock me off balance, and frustrate my ego. I have to admit, I actually like it now.",
			"    ",
			"    Part of the reason I avoided the pose was that I didn’t feel that I should struggle with it nearly as much as I was. The degree of ",
			"    difficultly that I experienced didn’t seem commensurate with the challenge of the pose. After all, standing postures like Utthita ",
			"    Hasta Padangusthasana, arm balances like Eka Pada Galavasana, and balancing in inversions like Forearm Balance and Handstand weren’t ",
			"    very difficult for me. But, three seconds into Warrior III and I would topple over.",
			"    ",
			"    Now that I’m no longer avoiding the pose, I’ve figured out a few things that make it much more accessible and effective. Go figure, ",
			"    now that I’m not avoiding something, I’m actually learning about it—shocker. What incredible insights yoga teachers have, right?",
			"    ",
			"    Here are the things that I’m focusing on in the pose:",
			"    ",
			"    1) Strongly rooting down through the base of the big toe.",
			"    2) Strongly adducting both thighs toward each other like I’m squeezing a block.",
			"    3) Engaging the spinal muscles and hamstrings (of the top leg) like I’m doing Locust Pose.",
			"    4) Firmly pressing my hands together in Anjali Mudra for a few breaths to help me feel the midline of my body before reaching my arms forward.",
			"    5) Holding my breath, thinking about the future, judging myself, and assigning blame to others.",
			"    ",
			"    Here’s a quick sequence to help you build up to Warrior III. I’ve been enjoying this sequence quite a bit lately.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 1-2",
			"    Simple, straightforward reclined Hamstring and Adductor lengthening to prepare for the upcoming demands of Warrior III.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 3-4",
			"    Paripurna Navasana and Ardha Navasana pair perfectly to strengthen your core. Bringing your attention to your center early in this sequence ",
			"    will help you keep your attention focused on your midline when you get the wobbles in Warrior III later.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 5-6",
			"    These two poses help you transition from the reclined and seated postures to the upcoming standing postures.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 7-9",
			"    This is a progression of standing balances with the legs abducted and externally rotated. These postures will get you tuned in to standing ",
			"    balances and they’re typically easier than the upcoming standing balances.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 10-12",
			"    These three postures shift the orientation of the legs and hips into the same orientation as the upcoming Warrior III.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 13-15",
			"    Parsvottanasana gives you one more opportunity to prepare your hamstrings for Warrior III. Many teachers transition into Warrior III from ",
			"    Warrior I. I prefer transitioning into Warrior III from a high lunge. I think it makes more sense for the hips. Check it out and see what ",
			"    you think."

			"    You know those poses that you once loathed, but now you love? At first, they had the audacity to make you feel awkward, ",
			"    imbalanced, and mortal. Then, somehow, they started scratching an itch that no other posture could. You know the ones. For me Parivrtta ",
			"    Trikonasana, or Revolved Triangle, is at the top of this list.",
			"    ",
			"    Things changed for me in Parivrtta Trikonasana when I started working with the pose differently. My experience shifted when I started ",
			"    putting it later in my sequences. I remember when I was an Ashtanga practitioner thinking that Parivrtta Trikonasa was too early in the ",
			"    standing sequence for my body. It was the first posture in the sequence to stretch my IT bands, adductors, external rotators and rotational ",
			"    spinal muscles. Even though I was in my early 20s, all of these muscles and connective tissues were pretty tight and Parivrtta Trikonasana ",
			"    was a slog.",
			"    ",
			"    The pose was enough of a frustration for me during my Primary Series days that I started to prep for it with a few outer-hip and IT band ",
			"    openers before class. I could accept that Marichyasana D was hard, but I couldn’t quite cope with the fact that I struggled with the fourth ",
			"    posture in the standing series. ",
			"    ",
			"    Eventually, as I moved away Ashtanga Yoga, I started building sequences that were entirely designed to make greater peace with Parivritta ",
			"    Trikonasana and address the tight spots that this posture revealed in my body.",
			"    ",
			"    This sequence came about from many years of trying to relocate Parivrtta Trikonasana from my “No thanks, I’d rather not,” list, to my “Yes, ",
			"    please—and I’ll have A few more,” list. ",
			"    ",
			"    Like all of my sequences, it’s accessible, simple, straightforward, and effective.",
			"    ",
			"    Take a few moments to look at the sequence before you practice it and you’ll quickly see why it makes sense. It includes everything that ",
			"    you’ll need to prepare your body for Parivrtta Trikonasana and presents these components in a straightforward progression. Fingers crossed ",
			"    that it works as well for you as it’s worked for me over the years.",
			"    ",
			"    And, hey, while we’re at it, let me know some of the yoga poses that you’re still struggling with in the comments section and how you’re ",
			"    going about managing them. Maybe I’ll create a sequence just for you!"

			"    Full disclaimer: when it comes to the morning, I’m a coffee first kind of guy. Yoga is a close second. But, it’s second nonetheless. It ",
			"    wasn’t always this way, but nothing is permanent. So, if you’re like me and you prefer some liquid inspiration to get yourself on the ",
			"    mat first thing, don’t judge yourself. Once you’re ready, here’s a solid, get-up-and-go practice.",
			"    ",
			"    This is a pretty simple, straightforward sequence. You don’t need to revolutionize the future of yoga sequencing before noon. You just ",
			"    need to ease into your body, get moving, turn upside down a time or two and chase the cobwebs away with some backbends.",
			"    ",
			"    Morning Yoga Flow ",
			"    ",
			"    Sequence",
			"    The sequence starts with three opening postures — Child’s Pose, Downward Dog, and Ardha Uttanasana — to slowly stretch the back of your ",
			"    body. Then, you transition into Sun Salutations. I have “Surya Namaskar A” listed here, but you can do any style of Sun Salutation that ",
			"    you like. I take my first couple of Salutations incredibly slowly. It wasn’t always this way, but, again, nothing is permanent. Take as ",
			"    many as you like and move at whatever pace you prefer.",
			"    ",
			"    Next, you’ll jump into a progression of standing poses. I like to practice Warrior II-based postures prior to Warrior I-based postures, ",
			"    because they’re easier for my hips. This is the order that I’ve chosen for this sequence, but I don’t have a black and white rule about ",
			"    it. I used to, but nothing is permanent.",
			"    ",
			"    After you’ve done a few openers, done as many Salutations as you fancy, and worked through your standing postures, it’s time to get upside ",
			"    down. If you’re not practicing Handstand, you could do Half-Handstand with your feet at the wall. Or, you could omit the inversion entirely. ",
			"    If you have a few tricks up your sleeve and want to do additional inversions or arm balances, go for it.",
			"    ",
			"    The sequence concludes with Bridge Pose and Upward Bow Pose, followed by Supta Padangusthasana. My backbends feel even tighter in the morning ",
			"    than in the afternoon. It’s always been this way — some things never change. Supta Padangusthasana grounds you after your backbends and rounds ",
			"    out the sequence. A brief Savasana or Seated Meditation is a nice way to fully close the practice. Usually, I include these, but I’m honest ",
			"    enough to tell you that sometimes I don’t. Once in awhile, it feels like I spent the entire morning sequence trying not to feel like a corpse.",
			"    ",
			"    OK, enjoy your practice!"

			"    I know back pain. I’ve dealt with varying degrees of back pain—from mild to severe—for more than 20 years. I’ve also worked with hundreds ",
			"    of students that have similar challenges. Whether their doctor has suggested trying yoga for back pain or they’ve just exhausted all other ",
			"    options, many students turn to yoga when they’re facing lower-back problems.",
			"    ",
			"    My yoga practice has provided me with an exceptional tool for managing my back and minimizing flare-ups. At the same time, there’s no ",
			"    one-size-fits-all formula for using yoga for back pain. Postures that soothe some students, agitate others. Yoga is for everybody, but not ",
			"    all postures are for everybody. With this in mind, the goal of this sequence is to provide you with some general principles and a simple ",
			"    sequence that may help you with general, overall lower-back maintenance. I’m hopeful that many of these postures–if not the entire ",
			"    sequence–will help you keep back discomfort at bay if you practice them regularly.",
			"    ",
			"    Of course, this sequence is not for acute pain, nor does it account for (or provide) specific diagnoses. If you’re in acute pain, please ",
			"    find a medical provider. Also, please omit all postures that are contrary to your medical provider’s suggestions.",
			"    ",
			"    One more thought: A detailed examination of yoga for back pain is beyond the scope of this blog post. But, before you launch into this ",
			"    sequence, there are a few important principles to pay attention to:",
			"    ",
			"    My Approach to Yoga for Back Pain",
			"    1. Focus on maintaining the natural curves of your spine, especially the lordotic curve of your lower back.",
			"    2. Focus on hip and leg flexibility. Yes, some students need more stability in these regions. But, generally speaking, excessive tension ",
			"    in the hips and legs needs to be addressed so that the pelvis can be in it’s proper position in daily life and in yoga postures.",
			"    3. Breathe slowly, smoothly, and deeply. Breathing settles the inclination for the nervous system to overreact and helps facilitate spinal motion.",
			"    4. Remember that there’s going to be a little trial and error. Some things will work for you and some things won’t.",
			"    5. Back off when something hurts. Period.",
			"    6. Lastly, all hygiene requires consistency. Consider this sequence good hygiene for your lower back. Got it?",
			"    ",
			"    Back feeling fine? Try Eka Pada Urdhva Dhanurasana or Ustrasana.",
			"    ",
			"    WHY THIS SEQUENCE WORKS",
			"",
			"    POSES 1-5",
			"    Reclined hip, hamstring, and inner leg (adductor) openers should be the bread and butter of lower back maintenance strategies. Yes, a strong and ",
			"    stable core is essential for lower back comfort. But, if excessive hip, hamstring, or adductor tension is keeping your pelvis out of proper ",
			"    alignment, no amount of core strength is going to protect your lower back.",
			"    ",
			"    These first three poses are so valuable that you can practice them on their own — especially if you’re not comfortable with the following ",
			"    postures. The first four postures of this sequence don’t require your lower back or pelvis to move. Instead, you keep your lower back and ",
			"    pelvis stationary and move your leg. Most of you will need to hold a yoga strap instead of holding your foot. The 5th posture introduces ",
			"    a mild reclined twist in order to help you create more mobility in your thoracic spine (the part of your spine that your ribs connect to).",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 6-8",
			"    In addition to mobilizing your hips, hamstrings, and adductors, strengthening your core is essential for lower back comfort. Two of the ",
			"    most effective core strengtheners in yoga are what I call “Core Connector” (pose 6) and Forearm Plank (pose 8). These poses require very ",
			"    little spinal flexion (anterior spinal rounding) to execute correctly. If the minor rounding of your spine in the “Core Connector” is ",
			"    uncomfortable, do a few rounds of Forearm Plank instead. In this sequence, I threw in Down Dog between the two core postures to help you ",
			"    focus on lengthening your spine, which can help alleviate back discomfort.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 9-10",
			"    Most people love to alternate between Cat Pose and Cow Pose. I don’t. Honestly, I just don’t find Cow Pose to be comfortable or effective ",
			"    in my body. Cat, I like. Cow, I can live without. So, I selected Sphinx Pose to pair with Cat Pose instead. Sphinx is the first pose in ",
			"    these sequence where you’re taking your back into extension. As you do this pose, don’t let your belly sink heavily into the floor since ",
			"    this may arch your lower back too intensely. Instead, gently press your pubic bone into the floor and draw your lower belly toward your spine. ",
			"    ",
			"    Notice how this pose feels in your lower back. Some of you will crave more, some of you will want to get out sooner rather than later.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 11-14",
			"    Hip openers should be a staple in your back care routine. ",
			"    ",
			"    Pigeon Pose is most notable for the stretch it delivers to the outer and posterior hips — especially gluteus maximus and the six external ",
			"    rotators that live under glute max. But, Pigeon Pose — like the two postures that follow it in this sequence — also lengthens the hip flexors ",
			"    that lay on the front of the pelvis. This is particularly true for those you with exceptionally tight hip flexors. ",
			"    ",
			"    Posture 13 adds the hip flexor lengthening by also stretching the quadriceps. This group is rounded out with a lunging twist since mild twists ",
			"    feel so good for many people with muscular tension in their back.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 15-16",
			"    Closing a sequence with a mild twist and a mild forward bend like Child’s Pose is soothing for nearly everyone who struggles with lower back ",
			"    discomfort. You can make Child’s Pose even more effective by directing your inhalations toward your lower back.",
			"    ",
			"    AND, if you want to feel more confident and knowledgeable about your sequencing skills, check out my online course, The Art of Yoga Sequencing. ",
			"    It’s great for yoga teachers and students who want to better understand how the body works and how to stretch and strengthen effectively."

			"    Your shoulders have a lot of moving parts. Each shoulder has 4 joints (GH, AC, SC, ST), plus layers and layers of soft tissues that ",
			"    include muscles, tendons, and ligaments. When you add the physical demands that the shoulders undergo on a daily basis to the complexity ",
			"    of the region, you wind up with an unavoidable truth: Your shoulders need regular—if not daily maintenance—if you want your upper-body ",

			"    ",
			"    ONE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT YOUR SHOULDERS, NECK, AND UPPER-BACK",
			"    ",
			"    We frequently take our body for granted. Even as yoga practitioners, we often forget the intricate subtlety and profound majesty of the ",
			"    body. When we take our body for granted, we forget that it needs our attention and care. We forget that our body needs regular—if not ",
			"    daily maintenance—especially as our body ages. I’ve watched my body through my yoga practice for 20 years and it’s finally become clear ",
			"    that my shoulders, neck, and upper-back need a simple, quick, daily practice if I want them to work optimally. I created the following ",
			"    sequence for myself a few months ago and I’ve been extremely consistent with it. It’s usually not the entirety of my practice or training ",
			"    on any given day. Rather, it’s a supplement. It’s simple, basic, and hugely effective. Think about it as the equivalent of brushing your ",

			"    ",
			"    My recommendation is to do this sequence several days a week. It’s only going to take 10-15 minutes and it will be worth every moment. ",

			"    POSES 1-3 :  Child’s Pose and Cat Pose",
			"    Child’s Pose and Cat Pose gently round the upper-back and release tension in the muscles that lay between the shoulder-blades. Since the ",
			"    head hangs freely in these postures, the muscles in the neck don’t have to work to support the weight of the head. ",
			"    ",
			"    This creates a nice, much needed rest for these often over-worked muscles.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 3-6: Yoga for Shoulders and Neck Tension",
			"    If you practice with me live, online or with these illustrated sequences, you’ll recognize this straightforward, 4-pose shoulder-opening ",
			"    combination. I use this mini-sequence all the time. In fact, you can think about these 4 poses as a “mini shoulder-opening sequence” within ",
			"    a sequence. If you don’t have time to do this entire practice, these 4 poses will knock plenty of the rust off of your shoulders by themselves. ",
			"    These postures will help create mobility in your shoulders by taking them through a significant range of motion. If sitting in Virasana is ",
			"    difficult for you—or, you want a little more movement in your practice—you can do this combination of shoulder openers in Tadasana, Warrior 1 ",
			"    or Warrior 2.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 7-10: Shoulder Opening Lunge and Forward Bends",
			"    Poses 7 – 10 are included to get you moving a little bit more. Even though this sequence is mellow, it’s nice to have a few poses where you can ",
			"    feel your body work. If you externally rotate your upper-arms and broaden your shoulder-blades properly, you will release the weight of your ",
			"    head and neck in down dog. This will help stretch the space between your shoulder-blades. Low lunge with your fingers interlaced behind your ",
			"    back will stretch your the front of your shoulders and chest. The two wide-legged standing forward bends will stretch your entire back-body and ",
			"    release tension in your upper-body by letting the weight of your head and neck to drop.",
			"    ",
			"    POSE 11: Dolphin Pose with Hands at Wall",
			"    Down Dog with the elbows on the floor and the hands on the wall is one of my favorite shoulder openers. It creates the same effect as Down Dog, ",
			"    but it increases the amount of leverage that you can stretch your shoulders with. To do this posture effectively, place your hands on the wall ",
			"    with your fingers pointing away from each other (your thumbs will face the ceiling). Keep your elbows shoulder-width apart. The most common ",
			"    mistake that people make when they’re practicing this pose is to lean their shoulders toward the wall. Instead—just like you do in Down Dog",

			"    I’m going to start this article with the same caveat that I included in my Headstand sequence: This practice is not designed to teach ",
			"    you Shoulderstand. Rather, it’s designed to break down the elements that comprise good, skillful sequencing for Shoulderstand (Sarvangasana).  ",
			"    It’s only intended for students and teachers who are already proficient in this posture. If you’re not regularly practicing Shoulderstand, ",
			"    please learn the pose in the presence of a qualified instructor.",
			"    ",
			"    Shoulderstand (also known as Sarvangasana) is a simple posture, except for one glaring component—the shoulders. It’s fitting that the shoulders ",
			"    are the exceptional aspect of the posture that bears its’ name. When the shoulders don’t comply with the posture, they create misalignments ",
			"    that can wreak havoc on the neck and make the entire posture feel out of whack.",
			"    ",
			"    Fortunately, a good sequence for Shoulderstand can help prepare your body where you need it most: ",
			"    the front of your shoulders, chest, hip flexors, and quads. Your shoulders need to extend and adduct in order to get into the optimal position ",
			"    for Shoulderstand. To visualize this: Imagine swinging your upper arms back behind you, bending your elbows, and hugging your elbows toward ",
			"    each other. Otherwise, your elbows will splay away from each other, you’ll lose stability that your shoulders provide, and you’ll overload ",
			"    your neck. The combination of extending and adducting your shoulders actions is not easy, which is why the sequence below focuses so heavily ",
			"    on anterior (front) shoulder and chest opening.",
			"    ",
			"    Admittedly, the flexibility of your hip flexors and quads is not as important as the flexibility of your shoulders. But, excessive tension ",
			"    in these muscle groups can negatively impact your overall posture, especially when you’re upside-down.",
			"    ",
			"    Let’s break it down a little further:",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 1-3",
			"    This sequence starts off with Ardha Supta Virasana, Down Dog, and Low Lunge with fingers clasped behind the back. These postures introduce ",
			"    three essential components of Shoulderstand. You open the front of your shoulders and chest in the low lunge, you open your hip flexors and ",
			"    quads in Ardha Supta Virasana, and you get upside down in Downward-Facing Dog.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 4 – 8",
			"    Postures 4-8 form the heart of this sequence. I snuck Reverse Warrior into the mix because it’s wise to do sidebends before backbend and ",
			"    because the posture adds some variety and balance to the sequence. Transitioning from Reverse Warrior to Ardha Chandrasana with the foot ",
			"    clasped is a nice, simple combination. Ardha Chandrasana with the foot clasped helps prepare you for the sequence of backbends to follow ",
			"    since it stretches the hip flexors and quads. I can’t emphasize enough how integral opening the front of the chest, shoulders, and thoracic ",
			"    spine is to a healthy Shoulderstand. Towards this end, postures 6, 7, and 8 are a straightforward progression of backbends. Bridge Pose is ",
			"    the simplest of the three backbends and so it could have been first in the series, not last. But, Bridge Pose does such a great job of ",
			"    replicating the actions of the upper body in Shoulderstand that I wanted to include it as the final backbend in the series.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 9 – 10",
			"    If you wanted a shorter sequence, you could skip poses 9 & 10. In fact, I like the idea of going from poses 4-8 straight into Plow and ",
			"    Shoulderstand nearly as much as I like including postures 9 & 10. Going straight from postures 4-8 into Shoulderstand provides you with ",
			"    the continuity of opening your chest since these postures focus so heavily on opening your chest and shoulders. That said, I’m including ",
			"    Child’s Pose and seated forward bend in this sequence prior to Shoulderstand because they’re good for soothing the nervous system. Ideally, ",
			"    Shoulderstand is a deeply nurturing, quieting posture. Practicing Child’s Pose and seated forward bend before Plow Pose and Shoulderstand ",
			"    may make these postures more beneficial by helping you settle your nervous system.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 11 – 12",
			"    Plow Pose provides the perfect transition into Shoulderstand and out of Shoulderstand. There’s no mystery here. Enjoy."

			"    WHY THIS YOGA HEADSTAND SEQUENCE WORKS",
			"    Let me start with a big caveat about this practice: This yoga headstand practice is NOT designed to teach you Headstand.",
			"    ",
			"    Rather, it’s designed to help you refine your Headstand by breaking down the elements that comprise good, skillful sequencing for the ",
			"    pose. It’s only intended for students and teachers who are already proficient in this posture. If you’re not regularly practicing yoga ",
			"    Headstand, please learn the pose in the presence of a qualified instructor. If you have never done Headstand, please don’t attempt it ",
			"    alone at home. Instead, you can choose to replace Headstand with Dolphin Pose in this sequence.",
			"    ",
			"    From a purely mechanical perspective, Headstand is a simple posture. Like all postures, Headstand contains plenty of nuances, especially ",
			"    with regards to the action of the shoulders and placement of the head. However in my experience, the most challenging aspect of the posture ",
			"    is becoming oriented upside down. Unlike deep backbends or forward bends, you don’t have to focus on a ton of strengthening or stretching ",
			"    to prepare for Headstand. Rather, you have to prepare your body, mind, and nervous system for the finer points of being aligned while you’re ",
			"    upside down.",
			"    ",
			"    Let’s break it down a little further:",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 1-3",
			"    The sequence starts with Cat Pose in order to bring your awareness to your shoulders and upper back. It’s nice to release tension in this ",
			"    region and bring your focus to your shoulder blades when you’re preparing for Headstand. The sequence continues with Plank and Forearm Plank ",
			"    in order to engage your core. Core strength is not as important in Headstand as it is in Handstand and Forearm Balance (Pincha Mayurasana) ",
			"    since the posture is less mechanically stressful for your midsection. At the same time, it’s important to be mindful of the role that your ",
			"    core plays in keeping your pelvis, spine, and ribs vertically aligned in Headstand.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 4 – 7",
			"    Poses 4 – 7 prepare you for Headstand by turning you upside down. Since Down Dog and the forward bends are slightly inverted postures, they ",
			"    can help you adjust to being upside down prior to Headstand. These four postures may also promote the focus and attention needed to tune into ",
			"    the finer points of Headstand.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 8 – 11",
			"    You don’t need exceptionally flexible shoulders to do Headstand, but you do need to have a clear awareness of what your shoulders are doing ",
			"    in the posture. Postures 8 - 11 are a progression of shoulder-opening postures that will mobilize your shoulder joints and help you focus ",
			"    your attention on your upper body. Baddha Hastasana, Gomukhasana, and Down Dog with your hands on the wall prepares your shoulders for the ",
			"    flexion that is required in Headstand. Garudasana complements these postures by preparing your shoulder blades for the protraction that is ",
			"    required in Headstand.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 12 – 13",
			"    Most of the sequences I provide here conclude with the peak, or featured posture. I want to help students and teachers understand how to make ",
			"    challenging postures more accessible with smart, effective, and safe sequencing. Headstand is no exception, but the final posture in this ",
			"    sequence is Child’s Pose, not Headstand. It’s important to follow Headstand with Child’s Pose in order to help decompress the neck, relieve ",
			"    muscular tension there, and provide you with a few moments of stillness to savor the effects of the inversion."

			"    WHY THIS EKA PADA KOUNDINYASANA SEQUENCE WORKS",
			"    When I practice difficult postures I have to be strategic. Since I don’t have the natural flexibility or raw strength to will myself into ",
			"    advanced postures like Eka Pada Koundinyasana, I have to emphasize preparation, efficient leverage, and technique. For me, this means ",
			"    breaking down difficult postures into small, accessible components.",
			"    ",
			"    EKA PADA KOUNDINYASANA QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS",
			"    I typically ask myself three questions when I look at a demanding posture like Eka Pada Koundinyasana I:",
			"    ",
			"    1. What are the legs and hips doing in the pose?",
			"    2. What are the core and spine doing in the pose?",
			"    3. What are the shoulders and arms doing in the pose?",
			"    ",
			"    It’s a simple, straightforward process that helps me — and can help you — take a complex pose and boil it down into manageable parts. ",
			"    One benefit of this process is that it provides you with aspects of every posture that you can work on even if you can’t do a particular ",
			"    pose in its’ entirety.",
			"    ",
			"    When I apply these questions to Eka Pada Koundinyasana I, I get simple, straightforward answers. The hips, legs, spine, and core are in ",
			"    Parivrrta Trikonasana The shoulders and arms are in Chaturanga. In other words, Eka Pada Koundinyasana I, is Revolved Triangle Pose on ",
			"    top of Chaturanga. So, this sequence focuses on preparing for a deep Revolved Triangle Pose and a strong Chaturanga.",
			"    ",
			"    Let’s break it down a little further:",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 1-4",
			"    The first three postures will wake up your core. More specifically, the 2nd and 3rd postures in the sequence will fire-up your obliques ",
			"    since they include a demanding twist. These postures set the tone for the sequence by providing you with a preview of the postures and ",
			"    actions that will follow. The 4th posture, Downward Facing Dog, gives you a smooth transition from the reclined postures to the hip-opening ",
			"    lunges.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 5-6",
			"    Admittedly, the hamstrings and adductors—which are focused on in pose #5—are not huge components of Eka Pada Koundinyasana. But, those of ",
			"    you with tight hamstrings will benefit from the inclusion of lizard pose, since it will prepare you for Revolved Triangle and Revolved Half ",
			"    Moon. Practicing Pigeon Pose will prepare you for the upcoming twists by creating more mobility in your outer hips and IT bands.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 7-11",
			"    Poses 7 through 10 give you a straightforward progression of standing twists. Each twist builds on the previous twist as the progression ",
			"    slowly increases in demand. These postures prepare your outer hips, IT bands, and spine for the demands of Eka Pada Koundinyasana. ",
			"    The 11th pose, Revolved Utkatasana, provides you with a standing twist that closely resembles the next posture in the sequence—Side Crow, ",
			"    or Parsva Bakasana.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 12-13",
			"    Parsva Bakasana is the foundation for all arm balances that include a twist. When you develop the strength, flexibility and overall ",
			"    coordination to do this pose proficiently, you’re also setting the stage for other twisting variations. Also, Parsva Bakasana is a great ",
			"    pose for transitioning into Eka Pada Koudinyasana."

			"    WHY THE PARIVRTTA JANU SIRSASANA SEQUENCE WORKS",
			"    Nothing beats a good side-bending practice. And, truthfully, the recipe for the classic posture Parivrtta Janu Sirsasana is simple: the ",
			"    practice needs to focus on stretching the hamstrings, adductors, and the sides of the torso (which are largely comprised of the lats, ",
			"    obliques, and the quadratus lumborum). The sequence above sticks to these three basic focal points.",
			"    ",
			"    Let’s break it down a little further:",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 1–2",
			"    What could be better than resting on your back and stretching your hamstrings and adductors? Not much. Supta Padangusthasana A & B are ",
			"    simple, effective, energy-saving postures that target your hamstrings and adductors and allow you to transition into your practice gently.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 3-4",
			"    You really can’t go wrong with Down Dog and Three-Legged Down Dog. You can use them in nearly any sequence, but I like them here because ",
			"    they continue the work of stretching your hamstrings, they lengthen your spine (which is helpful in side bends), and they provide a smooth ",
			"    transition from reclined to standing postures.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 5-7",
			"    This combination of postures flows together smoothly and builds on the work of you’ve already established by opening your side body. An ",
			"    important note here is that most students will only receive a mild stretch in their side body in these postures. This is ideal sequencing ",
			"    because you don’t want the first side bends in a sequence to be intense or abrupt. Most students don’t spend a ton of time working their ",
			"    side bends, so the muscles involved (lats, obliques, and quadratus lumborum) need to be prepared slowly.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 8-9",
			"    These postures hone in on the hamstrings, adductors and side body. At this phase of the sequence, you’re going more deeply into the targeted ",
			"    areas of this practice.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 10-13",
			"    This progression of poses takes you deeper and deeper into your hamstrings, adductors, and side body. If you have more flexibility, you ",
			"    can bend your bottom elbow and take it to the floor in gate pose (pose 12). Once you arrive in Parivrtta Janu Sirsasana, remember to bend ",
			"    your top elbow and lean your upper-body slightly back. Breathe into the side of the waist you’re stretching and savor the pose. If you’re ",
			"    stuck and struggling, there’s a 99% chance that the restriction is in your hamstrings and adductors. ",
			"    ",
			"    If this is the case, be diligent with the first 8 postures of this sequence for a few more months."

			"    WHY THIS FLYING PIGEON SEQUENCE WORKS",
			"    Eka Pada Galavasana is not an easy posture, but it’s a simple posture. If you take a step back and look at the pose, you’ll see it’s ",
			"    a combination of Pigeon Pose and Chaturanga Dandasana. Even more precisely, it’s Pigeon Pose on top of Chaturanga. This means that ",
			"    there’s no mystery when it comes to sequencing for Eka Pada Galavasana: Your job is to prepare yourself (or your students) for a solid, ",
			"    skillful Chaturanga and a spacious, supple Pigeon Pose. The sequence above does this by focusing on core strength, upper body strength, ",
			"    and outer hip flexibility. Here’s a detailed look at the method behind the sequence:",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 1 & 2",
			"    If you’ve practiced with me live, on yogaglo, or with these sequencing illustrations, you’ve probably figured out that I start a ton of ",
			"    sequences on my back. This is a reflection of my personal practice which almost invariably commences with me laying on the floor—especially ",
			"    if I know that I’m going to work hard later in the sequence. ",
			"    ",
			"    It’s an incredibly effective, low energy way to create mobility in the hips, hamstrings, and spine. The first two postures provide good bang ",
			"    for your buck. They require very little effort and they produce a fair amount of leverage to start chipping away at hip tension.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 3 – 5",
			"    Not everything you practice on your back is effortless. This combination of reclined arm balances will wake up your core, get your blood moving, ",
			"    and heat your body in very little time.",
			"    ",
			"    POSES 6 & 7",
			"    Now that your body is a little warmer after your reclined arm balances, it’s time to dig into your hips a little deeper. ",
			"    ",
			"    Postures 6 and 7 will help warm up your body for the even deeper outer hip openers that directly precede Eka Pada Galavasana.",
			"    ",
			"    POSTURES 8 & 9",
			"    I wrote earlier that Eka Pada Galavasana was a combination of Pigeon and Chaturanga. I’m sticking with this assessment, but there’s ",
			"    an important nuance that postures 8 & 9 address. Neither Pigeon nor Chaturanga require significant engagement of your hamstrings or ",
			"    spinal muscles, but, Eka Pada Galavasana does. Your hamstrings and spinal muscles help elevate your back leg in Eka Pada Galavasana–this ",
			"    isn’t required in Pigeon or Chaturanga. Postures 8 & 9 help integrate these muscles into your overall body awareness so that you’re ready ",
			"    to use them in the upcoming arm balance.",
			"    ",
			"    POSTURES 10 – 13",
			"    This is a straightforward progression of deeper and deeper outer hip openers that culminates in Eka Pada Galavasana. If you struggle to ",
			"    get your shin on top of your elbows and place your hands on the floor, your hips may be too tight for the pose. If this is the case, ",
			"    practice the hip openers in this sequence more consistently. If you can get the position above, but struggle to lift your bottom foot ",
			"    and straighten your bottom leg toward the back of the mat, you may need to work on core, upper-body, and spinal strength. Good luck!"

			"    WHY THIS FOREARM STAND SEQUENCE WORKS",
			"    This sequence leading to Forearm Stand focuses on creating greater range of movement in your shoulders. Tightness in the shoulders—particularly ",
			"    flexion of the shoulder joint—will distort the spine, pelvis, and legs. More often than not, these distortions produce a banana shape in the ",
			"    posture. When the vertical integrity of the posture is lost because the body has moved into a banana shape, it’s harder to sustain the posture ",
			"    because the rest of your body is overworking to compensate. Core strength can minimize this banana shape pattern, but it’s important to work at ",
			"    the root of the problem, which is almost always the shoulders.",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 1-4 ",

			"    rotation essential for all postures that take your arms overhead, especially inversions.",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 5-6 ",
			"    begin to warm up your entire body. Down Dog continues to stretch your shoulders and arms, while the Low Lunge with your fingers interlaced releases ",

			"    ",
			"    Poses 7-10 ",
			"    introduce balancing postures to the sequence. I always find that standing balances prior to hand balances help remind me to go slow and focus on ",
			"    my contact points with the floor. This helps prepare my mind for the demands of hand balances. Reverse Warrior is a nice inclusion in this ",
			"    sequence because it releases tension in the side body, especially the lats. Tension in the lats is one of the largest obstacles to Forearm Balance."

			"    everything feels better than it did a moment ago.",
			"    ",
			"    Compass Pose is a deep side bend that differs from its close relatives, Parivrtta Janu Sirsasana and Parivrtta Upavistha Konasana (poses 14 & 15): ",
			"    The upright, regal nature of the pose requires you to engage your core and spinal muscles. Instead of using gravity and laying your torso down ",
			"    into the pose, you have to work a little harder to lift up and lengthen your spine.",
			"    ",
			"    To meet these increased demands, this 16-pose sequence will:",
			"    1) Open your hamstrings and adductors.",
			"    2) Bring your awareness to your core and spinal muscles.",
			"    3) Stretch your side-body, including your lats, obliques, and quadratus lumborum muscles.",
			"    ",
			"    Here’s a closer look at the logic of my Compass Pose yoga sequence.",
			"    ",
			"    Compass Pose Yoga Sequence",
			"    Poses 1-3",
			"    : These three versions of Down Dog will help you settle into your practice and begin opening your body for Compass pose. The one-legged ",
			"    variation of Down Dog will accentuate the stretch in your bottom leg, while the one-legged variation with the twist will provide your ",
			"    first side-bend of the sequence. Feel free to lean back—almost like you’re going to “flip your dog”—and indulge the stretch in your ",
			"    side-body. Stay for as many breaths in these 3 poses as you like.",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 4-5",
			"    : These postures focus on keeping your spine long and stretching your hamstrings. This will prepare your body for the deeper forward bends ",
			"    and side-bends which come later in the sequence. Hold each pose for 5-6 breaths.",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 6-10",
			"    : This sequence of standing poses progressively amplifies the demand in your hamstrings, adductors and side-body. These postures flow together ",
			"    nicely and become progressively more demanding. If Bird of Paradise is inaccessible, feel free to skip it or simply practice the pose and keep ",
			"    your top knee bent. Take 3-5 breaths in each pose.",
			"    ",
			"    Pose 11",
			"    : Now that your body is warm, it’s time to open your side-body more deeply and approximate the shape of Compass. Parighasana is the perfect ",
			"    pose for the job. ",
			"    ",
			"    Take at least 5 breaths here and allow your body to open up.",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 12-13",
			"    : These two postures do more than open your hamstrings and adductors. They prepare you for Compass by requiring you to use your core ",
			"    and spinal muscles to lengthen up through your spine. You’ll need to sit tall in Compass. These two postures set the tone for Compass’ ",
			"    upright nature perfectly. Take 3-5 breaths in each pose.",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 14-16",
			"    : I teach this progression of side-bends all the time. It feels like a classic combination of lengthening the spine, reaching through ",
			"    the side body and releasing deeply held tension in the inner-legs and lower back. The three postures become progressively more demanding. ",
			"    If you’re body is not ready for Compass, take a step back and content yourself to work with poses 14 and 15. Stay until your heart is ",
			"    content in each of these poses and breath into your tight spots."

			"    In my 500-hour Teacher-Training Programs I have my students compare Bakasana and Titthibhasana, or Firefly Pose, with the aim of learning ",
			"    how to create effective sequences for each of these postures.",
			"    ",
			"    When the trainees look at the two poses side-by-side, they see something they usually haven’t noticed before: Bakasana and Tittibhasana ",
			"    (Firefly Pose) are nearly the exact same pose. However, the one major difference between the two postures has significant sequencing ",
			"    implications. We’ll get to the yoga sequencing implications in a moment. But first, let’s look at the similarities between the two poses. ",
			"    ",
			"    Take a moment to compare Bakasana and Tittibhasana (Firefly Pose) below.",
			"    ",
			"    Bakasana and Titthibhasana share the following similarities:",
			"    ",
			"    1. Both poses flex the spine.",
			"    2. Both poses broaden the scapulae while strongly engaging the serratus anterior.",
			"    3. Both poses require strong core engagement, most significantly the transverse abdominus, the rectus abdominus, and the illio-psoas.",
			"    4. The shoulder joint (or gleno-humeral joint for you fact-checkers out there) is at approximately 90 degrees of flexion in both poses.",
			"    5. Both poses strongly flex the hip joints and require the adductors (inner thigh muscles) to engage to prevent the legs from sliding ",
			"    down the arms.",
			"    ",
			"    In simple terms, the arms, shoulders, shoulder blades, spine, core, and hips are doing the same thing in Bakasana and Tittibhasana.",
			"    ",
			"    The one significant difference between the two poses is that the legs are bent in Bakasana and they’re straight in Tittibhasana. ",
			"    That’s all folks.",
			"    ",
			"    But—and this is a big BUT—straightening the legs has far-reaching implications that makes sequencing for Tittibhasana different than ",
			"    sequencing for Bakasana. When you straighten your knees in Tittibhasana (Firefly Pose) you:",
			"    ",
			"    1. Stretch your hamstrings. The hamstrings are contracting in Bakasana, but they’re stretching in Tittibhasana. This means your students ",
			"    need plenty of hamstring preparations in the sequence that you create.",
			"    ",
			"    2. Stretch and contract your adductor muscles. Tittibhasana requires you to stretch the adductors since the legs open at a slight angle ",
			"    when you straighten the knees in this pose. At the same time, the pose requires you to engage your adductors so that your legs don’t slide ",
			"    down your arms. To facilitate this, your sequencing needs to include both adductor opening and strengthening.",
			"    ",
			"    3. Engage your core (even more). If your hamstrings and adductors are the least bit tight, they will pull the weight of your body down as ",
			"    soon as you start straightening your legs. To counteract this downward pull, you have to fire up your core and create even greater lift ",
			"    than you do in Bakasana.",
			"    ",
			"    4. Engage your quads: Engaging your quads straightens your knees in Tittibhasana (Firefly Pose). Your quads also work with your core to ",
			"    flex your hips and support the weight of your pelvis. Your sequence and your verbal cueing should include postures that help your students ",
			"    tune into these muscles so they know how to engage them once it’s time for Tittibhasana."

			"    I know I’m not alone in my love for Handstand. It’s empowering, strengthening, and fun. Whether you’re working at the wall, in a studio, ",
			"    or trying to do the pose on a paddleboard, the following sequence will help you build a strong, stable Handstand.",
			"    ",
			"    Here’s a look at my thought process when putting together the Handstand prep yoga sequence.",
			"    ",
			"    I like to include four preparatory stages when teach Handstand:",
			"    1. Connect students to the core",
			"    2. Connect to the hands",
			"    3. Open the shoulders",
			"    4. Set the tone for balancing with standing balances.",
			"    ",
			"    Encouraging a connection to deep, rhythmic breath is a given—especially in sequences that include challenging postures.",
			"    ",
			"    I hope this practice helps you feel more calm, confident, and strong in Handstand! Please let me know how it goes in the Comments below.",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 1-5: Core Connection The first five postures in this sequence will awaken all of your abdominal muscles, pelvic floor, and hip-flexors ",
			"    in preparation for the Handstand that is down the road.",
			"    ",
			"    Your core plays two primary roles in Handstand. ",
			"    ",
			"    First, your core helps you move the weight of your pelvis as you jump or press into Handstand. Second, your core helps keep your pelvis ",
			"    stacked directly above your ribcage.",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 6-8: Shoulder Opening One of the hidden obstacles in Handstand is tight shoulders. If your shoulders are tight (specifically, ball ",
			"    and socket flexion and scapular lateral rotation), it will difficult to establish a vertical plum line. If your body is not well aligned ",
			"    from top to bottom, all of your muscles will have to work even harder to maintain the pose. By practicing these shoulder openers, you will ",
			"    release restrictions and prepare your shoulders for the demands of Handstand.",
			"    ",
			"    Pose 9: Connecting to Your Hands Your hands are the single most important component of balancing in Handstand. You have to learn to be mindful ",
			"    of and responsive with your hands in the pose. Down Dog is included in this sequence to provide you the opportunity to focus on your hands and ",
			"    fingers. By rooting down evenly through your fingertips and the circumference of your palms, you will imprint the work you will need to do with ",
			"    your hands in Handstand.",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 10-14: Establishing Balance Balancing in Handstand is hard unless you trained as a gymnast or cheerleader when you were a kid. Sure, ",
			"    it’s doable, but it’s still hard. These standing balances will get you in balancing mode. Allow your body to sway slightly and focus on breathing ",
			"    instead of becoming tense and rigid. Notice all of the activity in your feet, toes, and lower legs. These parts of your body in standing balances ",
			"    are equivalent to your hands, fingers, and forearms in Handstand. ",
			"    ",
			"    They have to stay active and responsive to help you maintain balance. I’ve included Triangle Pose in between the other standing balances to provide ",
			"    you with a strong and stable counterpoint.",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 15: ",
			"    ",
			"    Turn Upside Down Uttanasana provides a calming, grounding posture before you transition into Handstand.",
			"    ",
			"    Pose 16: Peak Pose: Handstand (Adho Mukha Vrksasana) For many students, getting into Handstand is more difficult than balancing in the pose. ",
			"    If getting into Handstand remains elusive, be patient and consistent with this sequence. It’s best to work on the pose in the presence of a ",
			"    qualified instructor until you feel confident getting into the pose on your own. In the meantime, this sequence will strengthen and open your ",
			"    body and help you make progress. For those of you who can get into Handstand, practice the posture at the wall and focus on holding the pose ",
			"    for longer increments of time—-ideally building up to one minute in the pose before working on balancing in the middle of the room. Good luck!"

			"    In order to prepare your body for Vasisthasana, you need to open your hamstrings, adductors (inner leg muscles) and outer-hips. It’s also a ",
			"    good idea to awaken your core and learn how to work your shoulders safely in the posture.",
			"    ",
			"    Here’s a quick step-by-step guide to the peak pose sequence above:",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 1-2: Honestly, I love to start practice on my back—especially when I’m going to tackle demanding postures later on. Supta Padangusthasana ",
			"    is the perfect way to settle in, slow down, and open the hamstrings and adductors.",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 2-5: I don’t LOVE core work—only masochists and narcissists, do (right?). But, honestly, I can’t avoid it any longer (I’m past 40 and ",
			"    I’ve gotta push back a little harder than when I was 20). These three poses will strengthen your center and warm up your body in no time. They ",
			"    also provide an “energetic” bridge between mellowing out in Supta Padangusthasana and getting things moving in the standing poses that follow.",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 6-10: Down Dog warms up the shoulders, lengthens the spine, and opens the back of the legs. When I’m focusing on Vasisthasana, I emphasize ",
			"    broadening my scapulae, firming the outer edges of my scapulae against the ribs (by engaging my serratus anterior muscles) and externally rotating ",
			"    my upper arms. All of these actions are essential for Vashistasana, too. Pigeon, Gecko, Uttanasana, and Prasarita Padottanasana open the hips, ",
			"    hamstrings, and inner legs.",
			"    ",
			"    Poses 11-14: In addition to opening the legs and hips, this combination of standing poses brings attention to the back leg. The back leg in standing ",
			"    poses is similar to the bottom leg in Vasisthasana. It has to be strong and stable in order to support the opening of the top leg. These poses remind ",
			"    me to stay focused on how my entire body works together in all postures.",
			"    ",
			"    Pose 15: Utthita Hasta Padangusthasana is a standing version of Vasisthasana. Think of them as the same pose with different relationships to gravity. ",
			"    I don’t have an illustration of the leg out to the side—but, be sure to take this version of the pose as well. This is a great opportunity to stay ",
			"    connected to your breath as you practice balancing. It’s going to be even harder to stay connected to your breath in Vasisthasana, so you might as ",
			"    well get started now!",
			"    ",
			"    Pose 16: My hamstrings and adductors are relatively tight, so Vasisthasana is still challenging for me. It’s accessible, but it rarely feels graceful! ",
			"    That said, I’m always content after I’ve worked on this pose. If this variation is too much, please feel free to do the posture with your legs stacked ",
			"    or your top leg in Tree Pose."

			"    I love creating sequences for Parsva Bakasana. I always have. Since the posture contains so many components, there are countless ways I can ",
			"    take the class. I can focus on a sequence of upper body and core strengthening postures before tackling Parsva Bakasana. Or, I teach a practice ",
			"    full of deep, detoxifying twists before guiding my students into this peak pose. Other times, like in the sequence below, I’ll create a more ",
			"    balanced approach where each of the posture’s components is equally prepared.",
			"    ",
			"    Sequencing for Parsva Bakasana is also deeply satisfying because a sound, logical progression can help students break through and do the posture ",
			"    for the first time. Confusion is one of the biggest hurdles to doing this pose well—-or, at all. Often times students are physically capable to ",
			"    do the pose but struggle because they don’t know the building blocks. A good sequence demystifies the actions and helps you feel your way into ",
			"    the pose.",
			"    ",
			"    Since Parsva Bakasana is the foundation for more advanced arm balances such as Dwi Pada Koundinyasana and Eka Pada Koundinyasana I, it’s a ",
			"    nice posture to emphasize in mixed level classes because you can encourage the more seasoned students to work on these variations.",
			"    ",
			"    Here are a couple of thoughts about the practice before you begin:",
			"    ",
			"    Sequence Focus: Parsva Bakasana requires core strength, upper body strength, hip flexibility, and spinal flexibility. The practice begins ",
			"    with core strengthening postures, then transitions into a progression of twisting standing postures. The standing postures I chose will ",
			"    help open your hips and prepare your spinal muscles for the twisting component of Parsva Bakasana. Finally, the posture hits its’ peak ",
			"    with Bakasana and Parsva Bakasana. If Bakasana is a challenging pose for you, please check out my Bakasana sequence. Take your time, be ",
			"    patient, and enjoy yourself—-even if you struggle a little.",
			"    ",
			"    Before You Begin: For a longer, more intense practice, you can begin with Sun Salutations. Feel free to include as many lunge salutations, ",
			"    Surya Namaksar A, and Surya Namaskar B as you’d like. Otherwise, you can dive into the practice below.",
			"    ",
			"    After You Finish: This sequence is predominantly twists. ",
			"    ",
			"    Twists prepare the body for forward bends and backbends, so, really, you can go either way after you’ve concluded Parsva Bakasana. If you ",
			"    want to do forward bends, Baddha Konasana (Bound Angle Pose), Upavistha Konasana (Wide Angle Pose), and Paschimottanasana (Seated Forward Bend) ",
			"    are a good bet. If you want to do backbends, I recommend a Low Lunge to open the front of your thigh before transitioning into a few rounds of ",
			"    Setu Bandha (Bridge Pose) and Urdvha Dhanurasana (Upward Bow Pose).",
			"    ",
			"    You could take a few minutes in seated meditation before calling it a day and resting in Savasana."

			"    This sequence is invaluable to have in your back pocket during the winter months. It’s not a high-intensity practice – it’s a healing, ",
			"    nurturing, immune boosting yoga practice. The poses encourage relaxation, reduce stress, and facilitate circulation throughout your whole ",
			"    body. These are the three most effective things that yoga asana can do to help support your immune system.",
			"    ",
			"    Yoga for the Immune System",
			"    You’ll start off on your back in a Supta Padangusthasana series, which requires very little exertion for those of you feeling fatigued. ",
			"    From there, you’ll gently open your hips, where stress and tension often pool. Then you’ll move into forward bends, which facilitate quiet, ",
			"    inward-drawn attention. You’ll finish with some rejuvenating yoga inversions that reverse blood flow and open the neck and shoulders. ",
			"    (Sometimes they even relieve sinus congestion, although too much inverting can make it worse, so listen to your body.)",
			"    ",
			"    As you move through the practice, give yourself permission to slow down and settle in to your body and breath. Try to be as gentle and patient ",
			"    with yourself as possible – especially if you have a cold when frustration and impatience can rear its head. These qualities—going slowly, ",
			"    nurturing yourself, taking your time—are your own natural antidotes to stress, depletion, and fatigue. I hope this sequence helps you tap into ",
			"    them and have a healthy winter season!"

			"    Lotus Pose (Padmasana) is one you were likely familiar with before you ever set foot in a yoga studio. Surely you’d seen sculptures of ",
			"    Siddartha or photographs of Indian sadhus with their legs tightly folded together in a pretzel shape. It’s a pose that’s associated with ",
			"    serene states of meditation — and the shape of the pose really does encourage quiet.",
			"    ",
			"    Perhaps the tranquil look of the pose is what makes us all pine for it. But make no mistake — it’s not to be attempted lightly. It requires ",
			"    an enormous amount of flexibility in the hip joint and if your body just doesn’t “go there,” you risk hurting your knees.",
			"    ",
			"    In the meantime, you can get many benefits with a sequence that prepares you for Lotus. And if your body is ready to fold into the pose, ",
			"    you will know. (Trust me on this.) There will be no knee pain, no stress, no sense of prying or leveraging or forcing. Instead, it will ",
			"    feel like you are folding yourself into the pose.",
			"    ",
			"    Forcing your body into Lotus Pose is not worth it in the long run. Pain in your knees or your hips is a sign to back off. Got it? Good.",
			"    ",
			"    Most students make the same mistake when they open their hips for Lotus Pose: They focus on stretching the outer hips but forget to open ",
			"    the other muscle groups that make up the hip joint. While the outer hips usually need plenty of help, the key to freedom and balance in ",
			"    your hips is working with all the muscle groups that affect the joint, not just your external rotators. I can’t promise you a Lotus, but ",
			"    practicing the following sequence will make your hips be happier, healthier, and more supple as you work toward it.",
			"    ",
			"    If you want to make this sequence a stronger, sweatier flow practice, feel free to practice several Sun Salutations first. You can also ",
			"    add standing poses, arm balances, and inversions to increase the intensity of this practice.",
			"    ",
			"    If you’re in need of a quieter, more contemplative practice, you can finish with seated meditation or pranayama.",
			"    ",
			"    Hold each pose in the sequence for at least 5 breaths and be sure to practice both sides before attempting Lotus Pose."

			"    Do you remember sliding easily into Hanumanasana (which you likely called “the splits”) when you were a kid? If you don’t, not to worry — I ",
			"    don’t either! It’s a pose that can still give me a challenge depending on the day, but over many years of practice, I’ve learned to find a safe, ",
			"    comfortable, and exhilarating place for my body to land.",
			"    ",
			"    When you first attempt Hanumanasana, you might focus a lot on your front leg and how tight it feels. You might think you need to spend ",
			"    exorbitant amounts of time stretching, stretching, stretching your hamstrings. But Hanumansana requires flexibility in both the front ",
			"    and back legs. The front leg requires hamstring suppleness, and the back leg requires openness in the hip flexors. When you can find a ",
			"    balance stretched between the front and back legs in Hanumanasana, you’ll find a balanced pose.",
			"    ",
			"    I always tell students that it doesn’t matter if your pelvis touches the floor in this pose — in fact, it doesn’t matter if your pelvis ",
			"    is miles away from the floor! Instead of jamming your body toward the floor (a recipe for back pain and other miseries), try to find a ",
			"    level pelvis, where you’re not tucking or overarching your lower back. Support yourself with props as you do this — you can stack blocks ",
			"    or a bolster or couch cushions underneath your pelvis for support. And don’t forget to use your leg muscles to support your endeavor — hug ",
			"    the inner thighs in toward each other and press your legs down into the floor to help you lift the pelvis and engage your hamstrings. ",
			"    It may seem counterintuitive to use your muscles while you’re stretching, but it will help keep your joints and the pose more supported.",
			"    ",
			"    Have fun and think of embodying the spirit of the pose’s namesake, the Hindu monkey God Hanuman as you lift your arms and breathe deeply ",
			"    in the pose.",

			"    Urdhva Dhanurasana, aka Upward-Bow or Wheel Pose or simply “Backbend,” is an iconic pose in the yoga canon. Visually it represents the ",

			"    ",

			"    do the pose. Instead of focusing on going deep, focus on creating evenness. When you practice this way, not only will the pose feel a ",
			"    whole lot better, you’ll be more apt to open the places that need it and derive the overall benefits of backbending! (An added benefit ",
			"    is that you potentially head off injuries because you’re not pushing past your edge).",
			"    ",
			"    This month’s sequence prepares you for Wheel Pose by opening the shoulders and upper back as well as the front sheath of the body — ",
			"    specifically the quadriceps and hip flexors. It also builds heat in the whole body. All of this should help you feel more ease, more ",
			"    space, more joy in your backbend.",

			"        There are numerous ways in which Iyengar Yoga can help to reduce lower back pain. Although there are many causes for lower back pain, ",
			"        it is very common for people to arrive at yoga classes with this pain originating at least in part from tight hamstrings.",
			"",
			"        Stiffness in the group of 3 muscles at the back of your thighs known collectively as the hamstrings can restrict the movement of ",
			"        your pelvis in relation to the movement of your legs. As a result of this restriction, undue strain can be placed upon your lumbar ",
			"        spine. A practical example of this is when you sit on the floor and straighten your legs to the front (dandasana). In this position ",
			"        tight hamstrings can tend to pull the back of the pelvis downwards thus reducing the curvature of the lumbar spine. This can then ",
			"        put the spine in a more vulnerable position as you attempt to sit upright. You simultaneously feel the tension of the spine being ",
			"        pulled downwards and lifted upwards at the same time.",
			"",
			"        Knowing that the spine can benefit from improved hamstring mobility can create a dilemma for many people. Positions that allow ",
			"        the hamstrings to stretch will often simultaneously challenge the lower back, potentially aggravating existing discomfort. With ",
			"        this in mind the following sequence looks to present a number of poses that can help you to safely improve the flexibility of ",
			"        your hamstrings in positions where your spine is comfortably supported. Poses that help to release tension from the lower back, ",
			"        and poses that help to improve the range of movement in the lower back are also included.",
			"",
			"        This is by no means an exhaustive collection of methods that exist in Iyengar yoga for helping with lower back pain. Instead ",
			"        it focusses on simple and practical poses that can be easily incorporated into a home practice. The poses shown here are not ",
			"        intended for anyone who is suffering from acute back pain, nor are they intended to be a replacement for treatment from a medical ",
			"        professional. This post accompanies the video “Iyengar Yoga For Lower Back Pain – Weekly Intermediate Class 49”. This class can ",
			"        be found in the weekly classes section on yogaselection.com.",
